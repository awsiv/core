<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview of concepts</h2>

<p>Cfengine is a system for self-sufficient maintenance and repair of
computer systems. Making cfengine as autonomous as possible, while at
the same time guiding it by strict policies, is a goal of the
cfengine project. To be autonomous, cfengine has to be able
to observe the state of a computer system and make decisions about it. 
In other words, it has to be able to perform <i>self-monitoring</i>.

   <p>The idea that a configuration management system would perform
monitoring breaks with the philosophy of most software for IT
management.  Traditionally, monitoring software has been completely
independent of change management software &ndash; but here we are rolling
them into one.

   <p>Let's try to explain. From an automation perspective, it makes no
sense to separate monitoring from change management. A repair system
needs to know when things are not working so that it can fix them. A
monitoring system alone is useless unless it can schedule a repair. 
The process of maintenance is therefore much more efficient if these
two complementary aspects of system management are integrated.

   <p>In this document we shall explain how to make the most of the features
that cfengine offers you freely. In the future it will be possible to
buy additional software that allows you to derive deep insights into
system performance and behaviour from the cfengine software, but this
document is limited to what you can achieve with only the free tools.

   <p>Since a lot of features have been added to cfengine lately, we'll assume
that you are running versin 2.2.3 or later.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Monitoring features</h3>

<p>Let's begin by thinking of the different ways in which cfengine can monitor
the state of a host. Cfengine is no ordinary monitoring system. It does not
simply generate warnings when certain values cross certain thresholds.

     <ul>
<li>Every policy rule that we code into cfengine leads to a check being
performed on the policy rule. If there is a problem it might result in
a warning, or in the problem being fixed automatically with not even a
message.

     <li>Some checks are implicit. For example, when ever cfengine scans
through directories looking for files, it is on the look-out for
different kinds of files that could be dangerous. It will warn about
these, so in effect it is monitoring your filesystems.

     <li>The daemon <code>cfenvd</code> collects observations silently in the
background of your system and records the patterns of change that it
sees taking place. It learns these using simple machine-learning techniques
enabling cfengine to classify the state of your system in a number
of different ways as it interacts with the network.

     <li>Each time cfengine copies a file or executes a script, it measures the
time this operation takes, and so it implicitly measures the overall
performance of your system. 
</ul>

   <p>These are examples of the way in which cfengine collects information about
the operation of each computer on which it runs. The question then is: how can we
view this information and what is it good for?

<h3 class="section">1.2 Intrusion detection</h3>

<p>A lot of companies perform monitoring first and foremost for security
purposes. Cfengine does not care about the reason for monitoring, and it
does not assume any special interpretation if it detects changes or events.

   <p>What is an intrusion or an attempted intrusion? This can be difficult
to define. If someone tries to login at root once? If someone tries to
login at root fifty times? Port scanning, SATAN or ISS scan? Someone
trying a known security hole? These things are quite uncertain.  The
aim of an intrusion detection system is to detect events that can be
plausibly connected to break-ins, hopefully while they are still in
progress so that something can be done about them.

   <p>Intrusion detection is a special form of fault-diagnosis. Faults (in a
security system) are events that are not supposed to happen, but the
fact is that they do happen. As with all fault diagnosis systems,
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) give the wrong answers from time to
time. Because it is so difficult to define what intrusion actually
means in a generic sense intrusion detection systems tend to err on
the side of caution and report many false positives, i.e. false
alarms.

   <p>One way of doing fault diagnosis is to compare a system to a working
specification continuously. This is essentially what cfengine does with
systems.

   <p>There are many approaches to intrusion detection. These go well beyond
the scope of this document. Suffice it to say that cfengine is not
meant to be an intrusion detection system specifically. One thing
cfengine can detect however is <i>change</i>, and unexpected changes can
sometimes be interpreted as tell-tale signs of something unauthorized
happening.  So there is scope for using cfengine as part of a
host-based intrusion system.  Cfengine does not, however, try to
examine and diagnose network traffic.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Change Detection</h3>

<p>Change monitoring is about detecting when stored data, or other
measurable aspects of a computer system change. A change detection
system is not normally concerned with the reason for a change, but if
you are monitoring for change then we shall take it for granted
somehow that you are expecting to find changes that you didn't plan
for yourself.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Cryptographic checksums</h4>

<p>The most important bulk of information on a computer is its filesystem
data. Change detection for filesystems uses a technique made famous in
the program Tripwire, which collects a &ldquo;snapshot" of the system in the
form of a database of file checksums (cryptographic hashes) and
permissions and rechecked the system against this database at regular
intervals. Tripwire examines files, and looks for change in their
contents or their attributes. This is a very simple (even simplistic)
view of change. If a legitimate change is made to the system, such a
system responds to this as a potential threat. Databases must then be
altered, or rebuilt.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Hashes or Digests</h4>

<p>A cryptographic hash (also called a <i>digest</i>) is an algorithm that
reads (digests) a file and computes a single number (the hash value)
that is based on the contents. If so much as a single bit in the file
changes then the value of the hash will change. You can compute
hash values manually, for example:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     host$ openssl md5 cfengine-2.2.4a.tar.gz
     MD5(cfengine-2.2.4a.tar.gz)= 6d2b31c4814354c65cbf780522ba6661
     
</pre>
   <p>There are several kinds of hash function. The most common ones are MD5
and SHA1. Recently both of the algorithms that create these hashes
have been superceded by the newer SHA2. Cfengine supports MD5 and SHA1
and it will support SHA2 as soon as the OpenSSL library supports an
interface to the new algorithm.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Change-Detection">Change Detection</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 Computing hashes</h4>

<p>Cfengine has adopted part of the Tripwire model, but with a few
provisoes. Tripwire assumes that all change is unauthorized and is
bad. Cfengine cannot reasonably take this viewpoint.  Cfengine expects
systems to change dynamically, so it allows users to define a policy
for what changes are considered to be okay.

   <p>Integrity checks on files whose contents are supposed to be static are
a good way to detect tampering with the system, from whatever
source. Running MD5 or SHA1 checksums of files regularly provides us
with a way of determining even the smallest changes to file contents.

   <p>To use the checksum based change detection we first ask cfengine to
collect MD5 hash data for specified files. Here is an excerpt from a
cfengine configuration program that would check the /usr/local
filesystem for file changes. Note that it excludes files such as log
files that we therefore allow to change (log files are supposed to
change):
<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
       /usr/local owner=root,bin,man
                  mode=o-w          # check permissions separately
                  r=inf
                  checksum=best     # this switches on change detection
                  action=warnall
                  ignore=logs
                  exclude=*.log
     
       # repeat for other files or directories
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first time we run this, cfengine collects data and treats all files
as &ldquo;unchanged&rdquo;. It builds a database of the checksums. The next time the
rule is checked, cfagent recomputes the checksums and compares the new values
to the `reference' values stored in the database. If no change has occurred,
the two should match. If they differ, then the file as changed and a warning
is issued.

<pre class="smallexample">     cf:nexus: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
     cf:nexus: SECURITY ALERT: Checksum (md5) for /etc/passwd changed!
     cf:nexus: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</pre>
   <p>This message is designed to be visible. If you do not want the embracing
rows of `!' characters, then this control directive turns them off:

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
      Exclamation  = ( off )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The next question to ask is: what happens if the change that was
detected is actually okay (which is almost always the case). 
If you activate this option:
<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
      ChecksumUpdates = ( on )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then, as soon as a change has been detected, the database is updated
and the message will not be repeated.  If this is set to <code>off</code>,
which is the default, then warning messages will be printed each time
the rule is checked.

   <p>New files are automatically detected, as they are not in the database. 
If you want to be notified when files are deleted, then set the option

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
      ChecksumPurge = ( on )
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.5 Tamperproof data</h4>

<p>Message digests are supposed to be unbreakable, tamperproof
technologies, but of course everything can be broken by a sufficiently
determined attacker. Suppose someone wanted to edit a file and alter
the cfengine checksum database to cover their tracks. If they had
broken into your system, this is potentially easy to do. How can we
detect whether this has happened or not?

   <p>A simple solution to this problem is to use another checksum-based
operation to copy the database to a completely different host. By using
a copy operation based on a checksum value, we can also remotely detect
a change in the checksum database itself.

   <p>Consider the following code:
<pre class="smallexample">     
     # Neighbourhood watch
     
     control:
     
        allpeers = ( SelectPartitionNeighbours(/path/cfrun.hosts,#,random,4) )
     
     copy:
     
          /var/cfengine/checksum_digests.db
     
                            dest=/safekeep/chkdb_$(this)
                            type=checksum
                            server=$(allpeers)
                            inform=true          # warn of copy
                            backup=timestamp
                            define=tampering
     
     alert:
     
      tampering::
     
           'Digest tampering detected on a peer'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It works by building a list of neighbours for each host. The function
<code>SelectPartitionNeighbours</code> can be used for this. Using a file which
contains a list of all hosts running cfengine (e.g. the <samp><span class="file">cfrun.hosts</span></samp> file),
we create a list of hosts to copy databases <i>from</i>. Each host in the
network therefore takes on the responsibility to watch over its neighbours.

   <p>The copy rule attempts to copy the database to some file in a safekeeping
directory. We label the destination file with <code>$(this)</code> which becomes
the name of the server from which the file was collected. Finally, we backup
any successful copies using a timestamp to retain a complete record of all changes
on the remote host. Each time a change is detected, a copy will be kept of the
old. The rule contains triggers to issue alerts and warnings too just to make
sure the message will be heard.

   <p>In theory, all four neigbours should signal this change. If an attacker
had detailed knowledge of the system, he or she might be able to subvert
one or two of these before the change was detected, but it is unlikely that
all four could be covered up. At any rate, this approach maximizes the
chances of change detection.

   <p>Finally, in order to make this copy, you must, of course, grant access to the
database in <samp><span class="file">cfservd.conf</span></samp>.

<pre class="smallexample">     # cfservd.conf
     
     admit:
     
     any::
     
       /var/cfengine/checksum_digests.db  mydomain.tld
     
</pre>
   <p>Let us now consider what happens if an attacker changes a file an edits
the checksum database. Each of the four hosts that has been designated
a neighbour will attempt to update their own copy of the database. If the
database has been tampered with, they will detect a change in the md5
checksums of the remote copy versus the original. The file will therefore
be copied.

   <p>It is not a big problem that others have a copy of your checksum database. 
They cannot see the contents of your files from this. 
A potentially greater problem is that this configuration will unleash an avalanche
of messages if a change is detected. This does make messages visible however.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Cfenvd, a learning agent</h3>

<p>Cfengine employs sophisticated machine learning techniques to learn
and compress information about the behaviour of each host into a small
round-robin database. Unlike monitors based on RRD-tool, cfengine
keeps data from several months' worth of measurements in only a week's
worth of space.  It measures not only values but keeps statistical
profiles of values too.  <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>Although <samp><span class="file">cfenvd</span></samp> is not a compulsory part of cfengine, it is highly
recommended that you run this daemon. It requires few resources and poses no
vulnerability to the system. It will play an increasingly important
role in future developments. 
<a name="index-Entropy-source-1"></a><a name="index-Encryption-keys-2"></a><a name="index-Random-numbers-3"></a>
In cfengine 2.x, running <samp><span class="file">cfenvd</span></samp> means that additional classes
are automatically evaluated based on how the current state of the host
compares to an average of all corresponding times of week that have
occurred over the past 6-8 weeks.  The analysis is accomplished by the
<samp><span class="file">cfenvd</span></samp> daemon, which continually updates a database of system
averages and variances, which characterize &ldquo;normal&rdquo; behaviour. Every
2.5 minutes, the state of the system is examined and compared to the
database values.  Unlike a file change, numerical values are not just
different, they have ordinality. The current state can be greater than
or less than the norm.

   <p>Simply being greater than the norm in a particular measurement is not
of itself very interesting. Random fluctuations in the patterns of
behaviour mean that the values are changing a lot all the time, but these
changes are not significant unless they become of the order of magnitude
of a standard deviation above the mean. Cfengine takes this into account
and classifies the current measured values on a scale of standard deviations
about the currently applicable mean. For instance, it might set the following
classes in <samp><span class="file">cfagent</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     RootProcs_low_dev2
     netbiosssn_in_low_dev2
     smtp_out_high_anomalous
     www_in_high_dev3
     ftp_in_high_microanomaly
</pre>
   <p>The first of these tells us that the number of root processes is two
standard deviations below the average of past behaviour, which might be
fortuitous, or might signify a problem, such as a crashed server.  The
WWW item tells us that the number of incoming connections is three
standard deviations above average. The smtp item tells us that outgoing
smtp connections are more than three standard deviations above average,
perhaps signifying a mail flood.  The setting of these classes is
transparent to the user, but the additional information is only visible
to the privileged owner of the cfengine work-directory, where the data
are cached.

   <p>The term `microanomaly' is used to describe two standard deviations
above normal, when the delta of the change is less than the arbitray
value of 5. This is a small number, and anomalies of these kinds are
generally noise. 
<a name="index-Micro_002danomaly-4"></a><a name="index-Microanomaly-5"></a>
Any deviation from the mean value can be called an anomaly, but as we
said above, anomalies do not necessarily have anything to do with
security, and definitely do not need to have anything to do with
system intrusions.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 Interpreting anomalies</h4>

<p>Simply specifying statistical number anomalies is not sufficient to
provide well-honed anomaly characteristics. Cfengine tries to organize
the information surrounding an anomaly first in terms of statistical
significance and then only later in terms of event characteristics. 
There are too many events in which the numerical values exceed thresholds
determined by an arbitrary policy. Other criteria are needed to pin down
which anomalies are interesting and which are not. As a second level of
policy filtering, cfengine provides a measure of the entropy of the source
IP addresses of the  measured data. A low entropy value means that most of the
events came from only a few (or one) IP addresses. A high entropy value implies
that the events were spread over many IP sources. These conditions are described by
classes of the form:

   <p><a name="index-Entropy-6"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">      entropy_www_in_high
      entropy_smtp_in_low
</pre>
   <p>Thus, for example, in the first case the class will be set if incoming
traffic at the peak event of the last data sample was spread evenly
over all the incoming addresses. Such an event indicates that the
resource usage is not due to a single source (e.g. an attacker from a
single location) but is evenly spread &mdash; perhaps just a coincidental
anomaly. In the second case, the low entropy smtp traffic must come
from one or two addresses and is more likely to be spam or an attack
of some kind.  These classes can be combined with the specific anomaly
thresholds (see example below).

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 Entropy and its interpretation</h4>

<p>Entropy is a word that has entered the popular consciousness in different
ways. In physics entropy represents that amount if energy in a system of
fixed temperature that has become unavailable for turning into useful work. 
It is commonly associated with the idea of <i>disorder</i>. In computer science
the term entropy is often used in association with cryptographic keys
and passwords. Bad passwords have `insufficient entropy', which we understand
to mean too little content in some sense. All of these interpretations are
correct but they can be misleading. 
<a name="index-Entropy-7"></a>
Entropy is actually a measure of how spread-out a signal is. In the case
of thermodynamics, it tells us how spread out heat is. An engine or refrigerator
needs some parts of the system to be hot and some to be cold in order to drive
work around the system. If the entropy is too high, the temperature is spread out
and there is nothing to drive work. Disorder could mean that a beautiful compact
crystal dissolves into solution and is spread out evenly. In a password,
low entropy means that all of the symbols in the password are close together
in the alphabet. A high entropy password would show significant variation.

   <p>Cfengine measures all kinds of different signals, from network connection
numbers to temperature perhaps. It does not measure the entropy of these
values specifically. However, for signals of network origin, it measures the
entropy of the addresses from which the connections arrive.

   <p>If all connections come from a single address, the entropy is low
(0%).  If each connection comes from a different address the entropy
is maximal (100%).  This information can be useful when interpreting
an anomaly. A sudden increase in web connections from a single
location might be an attack (or a search-engine), while a sudden burst
from many different sources could be a coincidence (or a distributed
attack).

<h4 class="subsection">1.5.2 Intermittency times</h4>

<p>Intermittency times are recorded automatically by cfagent.  They are
are complementary to the last-seen times above. Essentially cfengine
records the variability in last-seen times and calculates their
entropy. This statistic only means something if cfagent regularly contacts
a remote server. If contact is regular, then the entropy of the last-seen times
will be low, as the connection time will always be the same. However, if a
host connection is unreliable for whatever reason, the entropy will increase. 
Cfengine translates these computations into a percentage which is show in a
<code>FriendStatus(0)</code> alert.

<h4 class="subsection">1.5.4 Disk scans</h4>

<p>A measure that cfagent does not collect automatically is a scan of the
arrival process of disk changes. This is a highly disk intensive scan
so you should not perform this more than once per week. It is also
debatable whether it is worse running more often than once per
month. The distribution will not change signficantly and the
information provided does not change very often.

<pre class="smallexample">     disks:
     
       /filesystem
           scanarrivals=true
</pre>
   <p>The arrival process determines a best-guess inter-arrival time
distribution of files for a disk, which provides information about
user behaviour and possible performance bottlenecks. The interpretation
of this information is rather complicated and goes beyond the scope
of this document. If a scan has been made, <samp><span class="file">cfenvgraph</span></samp> will
output the scan data along with other graph data.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Anomaly Detection</h3>

<p>There is no system available in the world today which can claim to
detect and classify the functioning state of a computer system. 
Cfengine does not attempt to provide a &ldquo;product&rdquo; solution to this
problem; rather it incorporates a framework, based on the current
state of knowledge, for continuing research into this issue.  In
version 2.x of cfengine, an extra daemon <samp><span class="file">cfenvd</span></samp> is used to
collect statistical data about the recent history of each host
(approximately the past two months), and classify it in a way that can
be utilized by the cfengine agent.

   <p>The daemon may simply be started, with no arguments:
<pre class="smallexample">     cfenvd
</pre>
   <p>and it proceeds to collect data and work autonomously, without further
supervision. The cf-environment daemon is meant be
trivial to use. The current long-term data recorded by the daemon are:
number of users, number of root processes, number of non-root
processes, percentage disk full for root disk, number of incoming and
outgoing sockets for netbiosns, netbiosdgm, netbiosssn, irc, cfengine,
nfsd, smtp, www, ftp, ssh and telnet. These data have been studied
previously, and their behaviour is relatively well understood. In
future versions, it is expected to extend this repertoire, as more
research is done.

   <p>The use of the daemon will not be reliable until about six to eight
weeks after installing and running it, since a suitable training
period is required to build up enough data for stable
characterization. The daemon automatically adapts to the changing
conditions, but has a built-in inertia which prevents anomalous
signals from being given too much credence.  Persistent changes will
gradually change the `normal state' of the host over an interval of a
few weeks. Unlike some systems, cfengine's training period never ends. 
It regards normal behaviour as a relative concept, which has more to
do with local stability than global constancy.

   <p>The final size of the database is approximately 2MB. Measurements are
taken every five minutes (approximately). This interval is based on
auto-correlation times measured for networked hosts in practice.

   <p>Cfenvd sets a number of classes in cfengine which describe the current
state of the host in relation to its recent history. The classes
describe whether a parameter is above or below its average value, and
how far from the average the current value is, in units of the
standard-deviation (see above). This information could be utilized to
arrange for particularly resource-intensive maintenance to be delayed
until the expected activity was low.

<h3 class="section">2.3 cfenvgraph</h3>

<p>The data revealed in the alerts above conceal the basic patterns that underlie
the detection of unusual signals. However, this information can be extremely
valuable to an analyst. It shows that patterns of usage of a system over weeks. 
It shows stable patterns that can emerge in the use of particular resources
and it shows us when there are no discernable patterns of usage.

   <p>Knowing the patterns of usage for a system can be important when deciding whether
a host can cope with the load placed upon it. When is a client likely to
receive good service, or slow service. The data can have implications for
Service Level Agreements (SLA). 
<a name="index-Service-Level-Agreement-8"></a>
The data underlying the learned patterns of behaviour can be shown
using the additional tools provided.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cfenvgraph</span></samp>&rsquo; command
can use used to dump a graph of averages for visual inspection of the
normal state database. The format of the file is
<pre class="smallexample">     t,y_1,y_2,y_3...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which can be viewed using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnuplot</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xgmr</span></samp>&rsquo; or other graphical plotting program.  This would allow the
policy-maker to see what is likely to be a good time for such work (say
06:00 hours), and then use this time for the job, unless an anomalous
load is detected.

   <p>The cfenvgraph command is used to extract data from the database used by
the cfenvd environment daemon.
<pre class="smallexample">     cfenvgraph -f <var>filename.db</var> [-r -T -t -s -e]
</pre>
   <p>The command normally generates two files with format
<pre class="smallexample">     t, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4...
</pre>
   <p>in a sub-directory of the current directory &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cfenvgraphs-snapshot</span></samp>&rsquo;
(or <samp><span class="file">cfenvgraphs-</span></samp><var>TIMESTAMP</var> if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T</span></samp>&rsquo; is used).

   <p>The files are called
<pre class="smallexample">     cfenv-average
     cfenv-stddev
</pre>
   <p>and contain, respectively, the weighted average values of all the
recorded data and the square-root of the weighted variances with respect
to the averages. Data are weighted in such a way that older values are
gradually deprecated, becoming irrelevant after about two months.

   <p>Normally the vertical scale of each graph is scaled so that each line
has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0, this allows all the
lines to be seen in maximum detail. However, this makes it difficult to
see the absolute values of the lines. With the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>&rsquo; option, no scaling
is performed and true values are plotted.

   <p>The complete data span a one-week
period, and the daily rhythm of the system may normally be viewed as a number
of peaks, one per day.

   <p>The options are:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--help (-h)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>List command options
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--file (-f)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Specifiy file to plot. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--titles (-t)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>&rsquo; option is given, comments are generated at the start of the
file which describe the columns. These are in a format understood by
 &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vvgraph</span></samp>&rsquo; as title/label data. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--timestamps (-T)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-T</span></samp>&rsquo; option is given,
the output filenames are time-stamped with the current time, in order to
give a unique name. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--resolution (-r)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-r</span></samp>&rsquo; option is given then high resolution data are generated
(five minute resolution), otherwise data are averaged over periods of one hour
to generate simpler and smoother graphs. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--separate (-s)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>&rsquo; option is given, cfenvgraph generates separate files
for each metric, in the format
     <pre class="smallexample">          t,y,dy
</pre>
     <p>where dy is the height of a vertical error-bar. This set of graphs
combines the average with the standard-deviation. (Note that the
error bars show the standard-deviation, and not the standard error of the
mean i.e. stddev/sqrt(N)); the latter has no obvious meaning here. 
If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>&rsquo; is specified, then error bars are omitted. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--no-error-bars (-e)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>No error bars are plotted. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--no-scaling (-n)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The graphs are not scaled, so that (min,max) is mapped onto the interval
(0,1).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--erasehistory (-E)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Wipes out the average and variance of the named observation categories from the
learning database. 
</dl>

   <p>Note that the values printed for sockets always look higher than
they should for highly active services. This is because even those sockets
which are in CLOSE_WAIT are counted. This is the correct way to determine
a normal state based on the recent past. It is a local averaging performed
by the kernel. If one counts only those connections which are currently
active, one gets a distorted view of activity with a 5-minute sample
rate. To measure more often than this would place unacceptably high load
on the system.

   <p>Graphs may be viewed in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vvgraph</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xmgr</span></samp>&rsquo; (used in the pictures above) or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnuplot</span></samp>&rsquo;, or other graphical viewer. These graphs are not meant for
continuous viewing. The data are averages, not time-series.

   <p>For example, with gnuplot

<pre class="smallexample">     host$ cfenvgraph -s
     host$ gnuplot
     gnuplot&gt; plot "www-in.cfenv" with errorbars
     gnuplot&gt; plot "www-in.cfenv" with lines
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-xmgrace-9"></a>
The new version of <code>xmgr</code> is called <code>xmgrace</code>. It can be invoked as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     host$ xmgrace -nxy cfenv-averages
     host$ xmgrace  rootprocs.cfenv
     host$ xmgrace -settype xydy  rootprocs.cfenv
     host$ xmgrace -settype xydy  rootprocs.cfenv -hardcopy -hdevice JPEG
</pre>
   <p>If you see the error "Strings are not allowed", it might be because some "nan" values
have come into the text file.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Fluctuation profiles</h3>

<p>Any model of fluctuating values is based on the idea that the changing
signal has a basic separation of signal and noise. The variability of
the signal is generally characterized by a probability distribution
which often peaks about the mean value. Some tools and many papers
assume that the distribution of fluctuations is Gaussian. This is
almost never the case in real computer systems.

   <p>To see what the distribution of fluctuations about the mean looks like,
you can plot the distibution files.

<p>An additional tool for purchase will be available within the next year
to extract the maximum use from the data learned by cfengine on different
hosts. Even distributed systems like cfengine can benefit from exchanging and
comparing data, just as the brain can add a whole new level of cognition to the
collation of data from autonomously firing neurons.

   <p>Cfbrain is a project that will allow you to see beyond the simple traces
and anomaly messages that a system generates often spuriously. It will go
beyond the current state of the art and provide analyses that will provide
significant information about the state of a data centre.

<h3 class="section">2.6 Anomaly Class Summary</h3>

<p>When cfengine detects an anomaly, it classified the current statistical
state of the system into a number of classes.

   <p>Cfengine classifies anomalies by whether the currently measured state of
the system is higher or lower than the average for the current time of
week. The amount of deviation is based on an estimate of the `standard
deviation'. The precise definition of the average and standard
deviations is complex, and is discussed in the paper "M. Burgess,
Probabilistic anomaly detection in distributed computer
networks", (submitted to Science of Computer Programming, and available
on the web).

   <p>The list of measured attributes is currently fixed to the following:

   <p>The first part of the string is from the list:

<pre class="smallexample">     Users
     RootProcs
     UserProcs
     DiskFree
     LoadAvg
</pre>
   <p>Socket counts of network services distinguish between incoming and outgoing
sockets (to a service or from a client).
     <dl>
<dt><code>netbiosns</code><dd>Registers traffic to/from port 137. 
<br><dt><code>netbiosdgm</code><dd>Registers traffic to/from port 138. 
<br><dt><code>netbiosssn</code><dd>Registers traffic to/from port 139. 
<br><dt><code>irc</code><dd>Registers traffic to/from port 194.

<br><dt><code>ssh</code><dd>Registers traffic to/from port 22. 
<br><dt><code>wwws</code><dd>Registers traffic to/from port 443. 
</dl>

   <p>If you have tcpdump program installed in a standard location, then <code>cfenvd -T</code>
collects data about the network flows to your host.

     <dl>
<dt><code>icmp</code><dd>Traffic belonging to the ICMP protocol (ping etc). 
<br><dt><code>dns</code><dd>Traffic to port 53, the Domain Name Service (usually a special case of UDP). 
<br><dt><code>udp</code><dd>Miscellaneous UDP traffic that is not related to DNS. 
<br><dt><code>tcpsyn</code><dd>Registers TCP packets with SYN flag set. 
<br><dt><code>tcpack</code><dd>Registers TCP packets with ACK flag set. 
<br><dt><code>tcpfin</code><dd>Registers TCP packers with FIN flag set. 
<br><dt><code>misc</code><dd>Registers all other packets, not covered above. 
</dl>

   <p>When it has accurate knowledge of statistics, <samp><span class="file">cfenvd</span></samp> classifies
the current state into 3 levels:

   <p><a name="index-normal-10"></a><a name="index-dev1-11"></a><a name="index-dev2-12"></a><a name="index-anomaly-13"></a><a name="index-microanomaly-14"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>normal</code><dd>means that the current level is less
than one standard deviation above normal. 
<br><dt><code>dev1</code><dd>means that the
current level is at least one standard deviation about the average.

     <br><dt><code>dev2</code><dd>means that the current level is at least two standard
deviations about the average.

     <br><dt><code>anomaly</code><dd>means that the current level is more than 3 standard deviations above average.

   </dl>

<p class="noindent">Each of these charaxterizations assumes that there are good data
available. The <samp><span class="file">cfenvd</span></samp> evaluates its data and decides whether or
not the data are too noisy to be really useful.  If the data are too
noisy but the level <i>appears</i> to be more than two standard deviations
above aaverage, then the category <code>microanomaly</code> is used.

   <p>Here are some example classes:

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.7.1 Entropy</h4>

<p>For network related data, cfengine evaluates the entropy in the
currently measured sample of measurements, with respect to the
different IP addresses of the sources.  You can use these to predicate
the appearance of an anomaly, e.g. 
<a name="index-Entropy-16"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">      entropy_www_in_high
      entropy_smtp_in_low
</pre>
   <p>For example, if you only want to know when a huge amount of SMTP traffic arrives from a
single IP source, you would label your anomaly response:
<pre class="smallexample">     entropy_smtp_in_low.smtp_in_high_anomaly::
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">since the entropy is low when the majority of traffic
comes from only a small number of IP addresses (e.g. one). The entropy is maximal
when activity comes equally from several different sources.

<p>How shall we respond to an anomalous event? 
Alerts can be channelled directly to syslog:
<pre class="smallexample">     
       SysLog(LOG_ERR,"Test syslog message")
     
</pre>
   <p>Software that processes logs can thus be interfaced with via the syslog interface.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.9 Persistent alerts</h3>

<p>DEFCON 1

   <p>Another application for alerts is to pass signals from one cfengine to
another by persistent, shared memory.  For example, suppose a short-lived anomaly event
triggers a class that relates to a security alert. The event class might be too short-lived
to be followed up by cfagent in full. One could thus set a long term class that would
trigger up several follow-up checks. 
A persistent class could also be used to exclude an operation for an interval of time.

   <p>Persistent class memory can be
added through a system alert functions to give timer behaviour. 
For example, consider setting
a class that acts like a non-resettable timer. It is defined for exactly 10
minutes before expiring.
<pre class="smallexample">     
       SetState("preserved_class",10,Preserve)
     
</pre>
   <p>Or to set a class that acts as a resettable timer. It is defined for 60 minutes unless
the SetState call is called again to extend its lifetime.
<pre class="smallexample">     
       SetState(non_preserved_class,60,Reset)
     
</pre>
   <p>Existing persistent classes can be deleted with:
<pre class="smallexample">     
               UnsetState(myclass)
     
</pre>
