<h3 class="section">1.1 Arranging files</h3>

<p>Base your files on high level services as you do with bundles,
See <a href="#How-to-choose-and-name-bundles">How to choose and name bundles</a>.  The purpose of breaking up
policy into files is to limit the scope of the policy to manageable
amounts, making it easier to understand. It will only be easier to
understand if the casual user can immediately locate promises from the
name of the file.

   <p>You can place related files in subdirectories of the inputs to localize them. 
This also makes updating more efficient, as fewer objects need to be
checked.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The Nova/Constellation Knowledge base allows you to search for
promises, but everything will make more sense if promises are found in
an intuitive place. 
</td></tr></table>

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Where to define variables and classes</h3>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Note that all Cfengine variables are globally accessable, by using their
fully qualified name :<code>$(bundle.variable)</code>, or <code>@(bundle.variable)</code>,
so placing variables in one place or another does not affect their accessability. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>Variables should be defined as close to the place where they are used as possible. 
The user will expect to find variables defined:

     <ul>
<li>In the current bundle, first and foremost. 
<li>In some common bundle for generic, global data. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Variables that define global aspects of configuration, e.g.

     <ul>
<li>Well known path names, e.g. document root. 
<li>Site specific data, e.g. the email address of the support unit. 
</ul>
   can be defined in <code>common</code> bundles. This places them
in a neutral context.

   <p>The only reason to define a variable far from its place of use would
be when writing generically re-usable methods and passing data as
parameters, See <a href="#When-to-use-a-paramaterized-bundle-or-method">When to use a paramaterized bundle or method</a>. 
However, re-usability can make rules harder to understand.

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.3 How to choose and name bundles</h3>

<p>Use the name of a bundle to represent a meaningful aspect of system adminstration,
We recommend using a two or three-part name, that explains the context, general subject heading and
special instance. Names should be service oriented and should guide non-experts to understand
what they are about. 
e.g.
     <ul>
<li>app_mail_postfix
<li>app_mail_mailman
<li>app_web_apache
<li>app_web_squid
<li>app_web_php
<li>app_db_mysql
<li>garbage_collection
<li>security_check_files
<li>security_check_processes
<li>system_name_resolution
<li>system_xinetd
<li>system_root_password
<li>system_processes
<li>system_files
<li>win_active_directory
<li>win_registry
<li>win_services
</ul>

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Policy-Style-Guide">Policy Style Guide</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.4 How to decide when to make a bundle</h3>

<p>Put things into a single bundle if:
     <ul>
<li>They belong to the same conceptual aspect of system administration. 
<li>They do not need to be switched on or off independently. 
</ul>

   <p>Put things into different bundles if:

     <ul>
<li>All of the promises in one bundle need to the checked
before all of the promises in another bundle.

     <li>You need to re-use the promises with different parameters. 
</ul>

   <p>In general, keep the number of bundles to a minimum. 
This is a knowledge management issue. Clarity comes from differentiation,
but only if the number of things is small.

<h3 class="section">1.5 When to use a paramaterized bundle or method</h3>

<p>If you need to arrange for a <i>managed convergent collection</i> or
<i>sequence</i> of promises that will occur for a list of (multiple) names or
promisers, then use a bundle to simplify the code.

   <p>Write the promises, which may or may not be ordered, using a parameter for the
different names, then call the method passing the list of names as a parameter
to reduce the amount of code.

<h3 class="section">1.6 When should classes be in <code>common</code> bundles?</h3>

     <ul>
<li>When you need to use them in multiple bundles (because classes defined
in <code>common</code> bundles have global scope). 
</ul>

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p>Note, if you are converting from Cfengine 2 you should know the following. 
In Cfengine 2, all classes were global and it was common to define all classes
in a big unmanageable list. That meant that there was a chance of
class name collisions.  Cfengine 3 has both local and global classes, allowing you
to limit the scope of classes and define them more in context.

     <ul>

by the bundle, so that accessing <code>$(bundle.var)</code> adds clarity.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Never change system policy when humans are absent</h4>

<p>Never make system changes when humans are unavailable, e.g. just before
going offline for the weekend. No matter how careful you have been, mistakes
can be made and you need to have at least 24 hours experience with a running
policy to lend it your trust.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Never-do">Never do</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Never embed simple shell commands</h4>

<p>Do not embed simple shell commands with cfengine <code>commands</code> promises, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     commands:
     
        # Don't do this!
     
        "/bin/rm -r /tmp/xyz*";
        "/bin/mkdir /tmp/abcd";
     
</pre>
   <p><b>WHY?</b> Embedded shell commands like this cannot be managed by cfengine,
so none of the protections that cfengine offers can be applied to the process. 
Moreover, this starts a new process, adding to the burden on the system.

   <p>Most importantly, this approach works like a covert channel, making changes
that are not directly visible to cfengine.

Previous:&nbsp;<a rel="previous" accesskey="p" href="#Never-embed-simple-shell-commands">Never embed simple shell commands</a>,
Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Never-do">Never do</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.3 Never manage more than one cron job</h4>

<p>When you run cfengine, there is no reason to maintain separate cron
jobs.  Instead, use cfengine's time classes to work like a user
interface for cron.  This allows you to have a single, central
cfengine file which contains all the cron jobs on your system without
losing any of the fine control which cron affords you. All of the
usual advantages apply:
     <ul>
<li>It is easier to keep track of what cron jobs are running on the
system when you have everything in one place.

     <li>You can use all of your carefully crafted groups and user-defined
classes to identify which host should run which programs. 
</ul>

   <p><b>WHY?</b> This gives you a single point of definition for batch jobs. 
It encapsulates jobs under cfengine's tutelage, for improved control
and security. Finally, cfengine can collate and summarize the outputs
from multiple scripts in a rational monitoring process.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Avoid writing custom scripts</h4>

<p>Do not spend your time writing scripts to embed within cfengine.  If
you are doing this, you are not using the potential of cfengine and
you are not benefitting from the protections and efficiencies that
cfengine offers. Custom scripts should be for your specific business
operations, not for system maintenance.

   <p>If you are tempted to use scripts to achieve your needs, consider
jusing <code>methods</code>, and if necessary consult with support personnel
for advice.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 avoid running cfengine without lock protection</h4>

<p>Cfengine's adaptive locking is an important system protection.  You
should not run cfengine continuously without this protection, e.g.  by
running with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-K</span></samp>&rsquo; flag set, of by setting <code>ifelapsed</code> to
zero for a promise.

   <p><b>WHY?</b> System inconsistencies can result and unnecessary resources
will be consumed.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Try to combine tests and operations during file searches</h4>

<p>Searching through files on a disk is one of the most time consuming
operations for a computer. If you have to do it, make sure that
you are getting the most for your CPU-cycles and combine operations
in a single promise. This allows cfengine to optimize the resource use
of the system.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
        "$(site)/app/webroot/img/inside/extmans"

     <b>     copy_from =&gt; cp("$(kbase)"),

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 Try to make many small changes</h4>

<p>Changes to policy should always be part of a serious and considered
plan. They should not be <em>ad hoc</em>. That said, consideration of
changes should not be so time-consuming that it cripples human
resources, or leads to change-avoidance because it seems daunting.

   <p>It is better to make many small changes than few large changes.  Large
changes involve many interdependencies, which make them fragile to
unexpected contingencies. The risk of large changes is high. The risk
of small changes is low.

   <p>Cfengine makes it easy to make small changes frequently, without
operational repercussions. As long as humans are on hand during the
change to observe possible side-effects this.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.1 Always document promises</h4>

<p>Always add comment attributes to your promises to explain the intention.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
      # This is a throw-away comment, below is a full-bodied promise
     
        "/tmp/testfile"                      # promiser
     
          <b>comment =&gt; "This is for keeps...", # Live comment</b>
           create =&gt; "true",                 # Constraint 1
            perms =&gt; p("612");               # Constraint 2
     
</pre>
   <p>If a promise has a stakeholder that is worthy of special mention, then
use the promisee fields to add the name of this person.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
        "/tmp/testfile" -&gt; { "stakeholder@company.com" },
     
          <b>comment =&gt; "This is for keeps...", # Live comment</b>
           create =&gt; "true",                 # Constraint 1
            perms =&gt; p("612");               # Constraint 2
     
</pre>
   <p>If a promise depends on another promise being run before it, use the
<code>depends_on</code> fields to document the handle of the other prior promise. 
This allows tracing of the impact chain.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
      "/tmp"
     
           <b>handle =&gt; "make_temp",</b>

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.2 Always keep coding to a minimum</h4>

<p>If you are coming to cfengine from another scripting langauge, you
will probably be tempted to add a lot of `logic' to your cfengine
program, testing whether things are true and trying to control the
order of things. This is not necessary. You should think of each
promise as being a self-contained `nugget' that requires little
additional coding. The more coding you add, the more fragile
a configuration becomes.

   <p>The hardest part of using cfengine for programmers is letting go
of the reins.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.3 Always use lists to make the same promise about multiple objects</h4>

<p>If you have a number of system resources that all make the same
promise, then use lists to iterate over the resources in a single
promise, rather than coding the same promise many times.

<pre class="smallexample">     vars:
     
       "watch_files" slist =&gt;  {
                               "/etc/passwd",

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.4 Always use existing templates</h4>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the current <code>cfengine_stdlib.cf</code> file in the
software distribution. This contains many body templates, e.g.

<pre class="smallexample">     local_cp() remote_cp() secure_cp() if_elapsed() recurse()
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Use these pre-existing body templates whenever possible, rather
than inventing new ones. For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     bundle agent update
     {
     files:
     
      "/path/to/copy"
     
         comment =&gt; "Update the policy files from the master",
         perms =&gt; u_p("600"),
         copy_from =&gt; <b>local_cp</b>("$(master_location)","localhost"),
         depth_search =&gt; <b>recurse</b>("inf");
     
     }
</pre>
   <p><b>WHY?</b> The comprehensibility of your code to consultants and new
employees is enhanced by standardization of practice. If the global
cfengine community uses the same set of idioms, then communicating
policy will be simpler.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.5 Always use the system variables for system resources</h4>

<p>Cfengine provides indirection (pointers) to particular resources,
through its &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sys</span></samp>&rsquo; variable context. These variables adapt
to the operating system and user id under which cfengine is run. 
You policy will be more readily portable and you will need to
code fewer exceptions if you use cfengine's automatically adapting
primitives, e.g. instead of writing <samp><span class="file">/etc/resolv.conf</span></samp> for the
name-service configuration file, use <code>$(sys.resolv)</code>.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
       "<b>$(sys.resolv)</b>"
     
          comment       =&gt; "Add lines to the resolver configuration",

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.6 Always use variables as pointers to paths and servers</h4>

<p>You should avoid coding paths and names of resources directly in
promises. Use instead a local or possible global variable to point to
the resource instead. This brings consistency to the coding, often
shortens the references, and provides a <i>single point of definition</i>
for change.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     bundle agent update
     {
     vars:
     
      # A standard location for the source point (single point of definition)
     
      "master_location" string =&gt; "<b>$(sys.workdir)</b>/masterfiles";

<h3 class="section">3.1 Anomaly Monitoring</h3>

<p class="noindent"><b>Purpose:</b>

   <p>The purpose of anomaly monitoring is to understand the stability
of a system, both in terms of its run-time performance and its
architectural structure. Sudden changes on a system can be separated
from the normal slow variations.

<p class="noindent"><b>Remarks:</b>

   <p>Anomaly detection is enabled and performed by the <code>cf-monitord</code> daemon. 
Reporting of anomalies is not automatic however. Alerts must be promised
explicitly. This is normally handled by a <code>reports</code> promise.

   <p>Change detection of the file system is handled by <code>files</code>
promises in <code>cf-agent</code>.

<p class="noindent"><b>Example:</b>

<pre class="smallexample">

<h3 class="section">3.2 Batch Jobs</h3>

<p class="noindent"><b>Purpose:</b>

   <p>Batch jobs are run on systems in order to perform basic house keeping functions such
as updating databases or executing business related tasks.

<p class="noindent"><b>Remarks:</b>

   <p>Batch jobs should not be run every time cfengine runs, so you need to limit the
execution of each one carefully, using:

     <ul>
<li>Classes
Classes for time and location. 
<li>Locks
The <code>ifelapsed</code> parameter determined how much time has to have elapsed
before the job can be executed again. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent"><b>Example:</b>

<h3 class="section">3.3 Garbage Collection</h3>

<p class="noindent"><b>Purpose:</b>

   <p>Garbage collection is require on systems to prevent temporary or
antiquated files from consuming all available storage resources. It is
impossible for a system to survive in the long term without throwing
some data away.

<p class="noindent"><b>Remarks:</b>

   <p>Needless to say, care should be exercised when deleting anything from the system. 
There are many strategies to select carefully what is to be deleted. 
The <code>file_select</code> constraint is your friend.

   <p>In a centralized model of policy suggestion, policy updates are downloaded
from a single point of definition, from one or more policy servers. 
Maintaining this flow of communication from `central command' is what maintains
that centralized command.

<p class="noindent"><b>Remarks:</b>
It is not mandatory to centralize management, but usually there needs to
be some automated process.

<p class="noindent"><b>Example:</b>

<pre class="smallexample">     
     vars:
     
      "master_location" string =&gt; "/var/cfengine/masterfiles";
     
      "policy_server"   slist =&gt; { "62.109.39.150" },
                        comment =&gt; "IP address to locate your policy host.";
     
     files:

<h3 class="section">3.8 Security</h3>

<p class="noindent"><b>Purpose:</b>
Security is a vast topic. You need to start with a security policy
and then translate this into promises about the system. For instance
you might promise file permissions and access rules. You might promise
change monitoring or anomaly detection.

<p class="noindent"><b>Remarks:</b>
This is an open ended topic. Security should be discussed as a
human process, since most breaches come from within the system. 
Cfengine can then be used to implement hardening measures, and
monitoring of important assets.

<p class="noindent"><b>Example:</b>

<pre class="smallexample">     vars:
     
       "system_files" slist =&gt; {

<h2 class="chapter">4 Quality Assurance around cfengine</h2>

<p>A powerful tool like cfengine can do great good, or cause enormous
damage if used carelessly.  It is essential to have a strict
discipline when making changes. This is a human quality assurance
process.

   <p>Your general rule of thumb should be: make small changes, not big releases.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Policy changes</h3>

<p>Changes to policy should always be part of a serious and considered
plan. They should not be <em>ad hoc</em>. That said, consideration of
changes should not be so time-consuming that it cripples human
resources, or leads to change-avoidance because it seems daunting.

   <p>It is better to make many small changes than few large changes.  Large
changes involve many interdependencies, which make them fragile to
unexpected contingencies. The risk of large changes is high. The risk
of small changes is low.

   <p>Cfengine makes it easy to make small changes frequently, without
operational repercussions. As long as humans are on hand during the
change to observe possible side-effects this.

   <p>Consider the following issues in quality assurance:
     <ul>
<li>Create a schedule and policy for major changes. 
<li>Plan to acquire the complete set of components for release. 
<li>Assign human roles as well as machine roles for changes. 
<li>Label new policy release items uniquely for tracking. 
<li>Always document the policy changes using the comment fields. 
<li>Test prior to releasing into the production environment. 
<li>Test in the production environment on a small number of machines whenever possible. 
</ul>

   <div class="block-image"><img src="cfengine-bdma.png" alt="The policy lifecycle"></div>

   <p>There are four commonly cited phases in managing systems, summarized
as follows (see figure):

     <ul>
<li>Build
<li>Deploy
<li>Manage
<li>Audit
</ul>

   <p>These separate phases originate with a model of system management
based on transactional changes.  Cfengine's conception of management
is some different, as transaction processing is not a good model for
system management, but we can use this template to see how
cfengine works differently.

     <dl>
<dt><em>Build</em><dd>A system is based on a number of decisions and resources that need to
be `built' before they can be implemented. Building the trusted
foundations of a system are the key to guiding its development.  You
don't need to decide every detail, just enough to build trust and
predictability into your system.

     <p>In cfengine, what you build is a template of proposed promises for the
machines in an organization such that, if the machines all make and
keep these promises, the system will function seamlessly as
planned. This is how it works in a human organization, and this is how
is works for computers too.

     <br><dt><em>Deploy</em><dd>Deploying really means implementing the policy that was already
decided.  In transaction systems, one tries to push out changes one by
one, hence `deploying' the decision. In cfengine you simply publish
your policy (in cfengine parlance these are `promise proposals') and
the machines see the new proposals and can adust accordingly. Each
machine runs an agent that is capable of implementing policies and
maintaining them over time without further assistance.

     <br><dt><em>Manage</em><dd>Once a decision is made, unplanned events will occur. Such
incidents usually set off alarms and humans rush to make new transactions
to repair them. In cfengine, the autonous agent manages the system,
and you only have to deal with rare events that cannot be dealt with
automatically.

     <br><dt><em>Audit</em><dd>In traditional configuration systems, the outcome is far from clear
after a one-shot transaction, so one audits the system
to determine to discover what actually happened. In cfengine, changes
are not just initiated once, but locally audited and maintained. 
Decision outcomes are assured by design in cfengine and maintained
automatically, so the main worry is managing conflicting
intentions. Users can sit back and examine regular reports of
compliance generated by the agents, without having to arrange
for new `roll out' transactions.

   </dl>

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<em>ROLL-OUT and ROLL-BACK?  You should not think of cfengine with a
roll-out system, i.e. one that attempts to force out absolute changes
and perhaps reverse them in case of error. Roll-out and roll-back are
theoretically flawed concepts that only sometimes work in practice. 
With cfengine, you publish a sequences of policy revisions, always
moving forward (because like it or not, time only goes in one
direction).  All of the desired-state changes are managed locally by
each individual computer, and continuously repaired to ensure on-going
compliance with policy. </em>

<h3 class="section">4.2 The policy decision flow</h3>

<p>Cfengine does not make many absolute choices. Almost everything about
its behaviour is matter of policy and can be changed.  However, a
structure for use, like the following, is recommended (see figure).

   <p>In order to keep operations as simple as possible, cfengine maintains
a private working directory on each machine referred to in
documentation as WORKDIR and in policy by the variable
<code>$(sys.workdir)</code>. By default, this is located at
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">C:\var\cfengine</span></samp>. It contains everything
cfengine needs to run.

   <p>The figure below shows how decisions flow through the parts of a system.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="arch.png" alt="The cfengine architecture"></div>

     <ul>
<li>It makes sense to have a single point of coordination.  Decisions are
therefore usually made in a single location (the Policy Definition
Point).  The history of decisions and changes can be tracked by a
version control system of your choice (e.g. SubVersion).

     <li>Decisions are made by editing cfengine's policy file
<samp><span class="file">promises.cf</span></samp> on one of its included children. This process is
carried out off-line.

     <li>Once decisions have been formalized and coded, this new policy is
copied <em>manually</em> (a human decision) to a <em>decision
distribution point</em>, which by default is located in the directory
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> on all policy distribution servers.

     <p>In this introduction, we shall assume that there is only one central
policy distribution server, a specially-appointed server which is
referred to simple as the <code>policy server</code>.

     <li>Every client machine contacts the policy server and downloads these
updates. The policy server can be replicated if the number of clients
is very large, but we shall assume here that there is only one policy
server. 
</ul>

   <p>Once a client machine has a copy of the policy, it extracts only those
promise proposals that are relevant to it, and implements any changes
without human assistance.  This is how cfengine manages change.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p><em>WHY DO THIS? Cfengine tries to minimize dependencies by decoupling
processes. By following this pull-based architecture, cfengine will
tolerate network outages and will recover from deployment errors
easily. By placing the burden of responsibility for decision at the
top, and for implementation at the bottom, we avoid needless fragility
and keep two independent quality assurance processes apart.</em>

<h3 class="section">4.3 Version control and rollback</h3>

<p>Cfengine does not provide specific tools for versioning promise
specifications. It is recommended to use a tool such as subversion for
this.  Cfengine does allow you to track changes and keep versions of
non-trivial changes, such as file content changes.

   <p>Subversion maintains revision numbers on files. It is useful to be
able to refer to version names or numbers also in cfengine. A version
string can be added to files as follows:
<pre class="smallexample">     body common control
     {
     version =&gt; 1.2.3
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>This defines the version number of a set of configuration files
which is referred to in reference messages from cfengine.

   <p>When cfengine saves a current version of a file that it is modifying
or replacing, by default such files are given a new extension and
remain within the same directory which they were
encountered. Alternatively, one can specify a repository directory to
which such files can be moved instead. The repository location is
specified in the <code>control</code> section:
<pre class="smallexample">     
     body agent control
     {
     default_respository =&gt; "/var/cfengine/repository";
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>Files moved to the repository are given names reflecting their full path, with slashes replaced
by underscore characters. For some, this creates a clearer overview of the
changes that have occurred.

</div>

<h3 class="section">4.4 Delegating responsibility</h3>

<p>In a large organization, you delegate responsibility for different
issues to different teams.  Cfengine has no meta-access control
mechanism which can decide who may write policy rules on what
issue. To create such a mechanism, there would have to be a monitor
which could identify users, and an authority mechanism that would
disallow certain users to write rules of certain types about certain
objects on certain hosts. Although it is <em>possible</em> to create such
a system, it would be both technically difficult, very cumbersome
to use and would add a whole new level of complexity to policy and
potential error to the configuration process.

   <p>To keep matters as simple as possible, we avoid this and propose a
different approach. Promise theory (cfengine's basis) reveals a
straightforward answer to model the security implications of this (see
the figure of the bow-tie structure). A simple method of delegating is
the following.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Delegate responsibility for different issues to admin teams 1,2,3, etc. 
<li>Make each of these teams responsible for version control of their own
configuration rules. 
<li>Make an intermediate agent responsible for collating and vetting the rules, checking for
irregularities and conflicts. This agent must promise to disallow rules by
one team that are the responsibility of another team. The agent could be a
layer of software, but a cheaper and more manageable solution is the make this
another group of one or more humans.

     <li>Make the resulting collated configuration version controlled. Publish
approved promises for all hosts to download from a trusted source.

        </ol>

   <p>A review procedure for policy promises is a good
solution if you want to delegate responsibility for different parts of
a policy to different sources. Human judgement is irreplaceable, and tools
can be added to make conflicts easier to detect.

   <p>Promise theory underlines that, if a host of computing device accepts
policy from any source, then it is alone and entirely responsible for
this decision. The ultimate responsibility for the published version
policy is the vetting agent. This creates a shallow hierarchy, but
there is no reason why this formal body could not be comprised of
representatives from the multiple teams.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="delegate.png" alt="Delegation of responsibility requires vetting access"></div>

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p>Run several cfengines? Another way to delegate cfengine control for
users that only require limited privileges would be to run several
agents as non-root users. This only works however if the tasks
delegated are very self-contained and require no special privilege.
