<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is organizational complexity?</h3>

<p>Complexity is a measure of the amount of information needed to explain
something. It implies a `mental cost' (and therefore a time and
monetary cost) to comprehend a pattern of structure and behaviour.

   <p>The term organization has two distinct meanings in English: it can be
intended as a euphemism for an <i>institution</i> or a business, and it
can be intended to mean an ordered <i>structural pattern</i> (i.e. the
state of being organized).  To avoid confusion, we shall refer to
businesses and public institutions as enterprises, and use the term
organization to mean an architectural pattern with a certain level of
complexity.

   <p>Organizational Complexity is therefore the amount of information, and
hence cost, needed to manage an enterprise or system. In information
science, the complexity of a system is commonly defined as the length
of the shortest document that fully describes it. A complex system
requires a long document to capture its workings; a simple system
requires only a short document.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is federation?</h3>

<p>A federation is a pattern of organization obtained by merging a number
of initially independent parts. The implication is that the resulting
organization is not a singular rigid unit, but rather a more loosely
coupled collective of autonomous parts.

   <p>Federation is a natural structure for any enterprise that has parts
with fundamentally different functions or orgins.  It can also be a
stepping stone on the way from a set of independent actors to a state
of unified integration.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Companies that merge or acquire other companies, as well as
companies that reorganize to outsource tasks are natural candidates
for federated management. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Promise theory predicts that a federated organization is naturally
<i>service oriented</i>, with two main architectures:
     <ul>
<li>The different parts of the collective bind together
by promising each other services.

     <li>The parts offer services to external parties, but are bound
together by promising to coordinate with a central entity.

   </ul>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Coordination, hierarchy and centralization</h3>

<p>Federated parts of an enterprise are said to be coordinated by an
entity, if they receive common information from it. Merely delivering
services (i.e. keeping promises) to a common entity does not lead to
coordination. Think of an orchestra. The conductor does not bring
about any coordination simply by listening, but rather by providing
common signals to the federated agents. On the other hand, the
conductor is a bottleneck who throttles the productivity of the
federated agents. If the agents rely too much on the conductor, or are
discouraged from acting independently, the amplification of effort is lost.

<div align="center"><img src="coordination.png" alt="coordination.png"></div>
<div align="center">Coordination implies common knowledge.</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
The need for coordination is often exaggerated in human organizations
&ndash; it comes from an unrealistic desire to absolutely determine the
outcome of decisions. Realistically, it is only a means to bring
consistency to distributed parts.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In ITIL and current IT parlance, a central hub containing coordination
information is called a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). The
term CMDB refers to a range of quite different approaches to
coordinating information that will not be discussed here. 
In Object Orientation, the term <i>inheritance</i> is used to signify the
use of common information by federated parts. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

It is possible for federated parts to inherit coordinating information
from more than one source, just as it is possible for someone to have
two different jobs. In that case, one must be careful to avoid
conflicting directions. As organizational complexity grows, the
possibility of conflicting direction and expectation also grows unless strict principles
are adhered to.

   <p>Promise Theory tells us that such conflicts can only be resolved by a
party receiving information, not by the parties sending it. This leads
to the model known as `voluntary cooperation' used by Cfengine, which
implies that each federated part must effectively choose which inputs it is
willing to use from external parties.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The Authority Paradox</h3>

<p>For some, the idea that an organization should be built on voluntary
cooperation sounds wrong. However, no matter how much we might crave
certainty of outcome, making demands on the compliance of federated parts
does nothing to improve that certainty; indeed, it can
have the reverse effect. The confusion lies in a misunderstanding of desired
authority over the actual power to change, i.e. in what is intended or desired and
what is actually possible. Promise Theory resolves this confusion
by building a model based directly on the agents that can effect change.

   <p>Authority is about who, in an enterprise, may decide what is
intended. Most people perceive authority through hierarchies or
`chains of command' in which the top of the hierarchical pyramid is
the master, and the layers below must follow: those at the top are
more powerful than those on the bottom. This is a cultural
prejudice. However this perception is, at best misleading, and in fact
is incorrect.

   <p>Humans have been organizing things into hierarchies for most of
recorded history. We have a deeply held notion that favours
hierarchies as an organizational form. It is worth examining why.  In
early times the upper echelons of hierarchy were the strong and the
educated, served by a relatively unspecialised workforce. They wielded
their power by guile and by violent force, and the lower layers cowered
in fear. From Kings and leaders to middle managers and class-system
underdogs, institutions and government, documents and tables of
contents, everywhere we look we see hierarchical structures.

   <pre class="sp">

<div align="center"><img src="brainbrawn.png" alt="brainbrawn.png"></div>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center">The authority paradox</div>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Today, education and peaceful society turns the reality of the power
hierarchy upside down: the true specialists are at the bottom of the
hierarchy, closer to the levers and the expertise to effect change. 
Today `low level' means more specialised, not less educated.  Low
level experts are held together by relatively unspecialised `managers'
who serve mainly as coordinators and communications links. However,
the culture and perception of authority from the top remains today.

   <p>These changes create a paradox in modern systems. The leadership of
intent is assumed to come from above, but the real power to act is
down below. This necessitates the binding together of organizations
by a social contract of <i>voluntary cooperation</i>.

   <p>The same is true in computer systems.  Most system designs assume
that the point of command will be placed at the top of an
organizational tree, and that every part of the system (represented in
the branches and leaves) will follow the commands made from the top. 
This turns out to be a poor model because, in reality, the top has
neither the knowledge nor the proximity to enforce changes below.

   <p>No central management of either enterprise or computers can force
individual agents to comply with their wishes, without their low level
consent. The perception of authority is thus only a
fiction<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The social contract</h3>

<p>Social contracts lie at the heart of all human and computer
organizations.  For computers these contracts may be as simple as
`access control settings', nonetheless there are human politics behind
them.  Most enterprises struggle more with their internal sociology
(or politics) than with their technological solutions.

   <p>When an organization is formed by merging independent parts, this is
especially important. The loss of identity and the feeling of loss of
autonomy by these parts can fuel a breakdown of the social contract &ndash;
i.e. a loss of loss of voluntary cooperation. In terms of system
management, it therefore makes sense to preserve as much of the
identity and autonomy of the parts as possible.

   <p>From an information perspective, this is also the lowest cost solution. 
The expertise to run the merged entity already exists within
it<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the proximity to make
change is automatic, so to increase the organizational distance
between decision, expertise and change will at best lead to increased
overhead and at worst lead to the disconnection of decision making from
expertise.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Service oriented federation</h3>

<p>Service oriented means business oriented. 
Let us now consider what this means for IT configuration. In
particular, how should a Cfengine configuration be structured for an
efficient organization?  In the examples below, we shall adopt a
service oriented view, in which an enterprise is organized as a set of
federated entities, some of whom depend on each other for services.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Disconnected parts inheriting a single baseline</h3>

<p>A more common model for federation is to have a baseline constitution
for all the parts of the enterprise defined by an umbrella
organization. We can refer to this as a `global infrastructure'
service.

   <p>Traditionally (i.e. hierarchically) one would think of this global
entity as being superior to the other entities, i.e. making them
subordinate, but this is not necessary, nor correct according to the
reality. The role of the global service is rather to provide a point
of consistent coordination, or centralized expertise to the others. 
Compliance with the proposals of the global coordinator will be
assured if it plays a valuable roles.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Since the real power to change still lies in the hands of the
federated entities, the global infrastructure unit must build
a social contract with them to assure that its wishes are
complied with. This goal is attended to by making the global
entity a valued service  for the federated entities. If the
global service is perceived as being of no value, it will be
ignored.

The next step from full autonomy is thus to use methods that
have been defined by an enterprise-wide global infrastructure service.

The Cfengine code snippet above represents the Cfengine configuration
for any of the hosts in one of the federated departments. The
configuration is extremely simple. It begins by downloading the
<samp><span class="file">baseline.cf</span></samp> configuration, provided by the global
infrastructure service, and then goes on to promise to use this as a
`method'. Finally, the major part of the configuration is the set of
special promises determined by the department itself. Federation is thus
technically trivial. The difficulties are rather conceptual and
sociological.

   <p>Let us remark on the likelihood for conflict.  Although the source of
the baseline is external, Cfengine configuration promises are always
implemented by the federated departments themselves, none are (or can
be) implemented by any external party such as the infrastructure
service. Thus, it is the responsibility of federated departments to
ensure that there are no conflicts between the baseline and their own
promises. Moreover, as the parts have no power to change the baseline, but
have agreed to follow it, the logical outcome must be that their own
special promises must not conflict with the global infrastructure
proposal. So all requirements are met without the need for central enforcement.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Handling multiple sources</h3>

<p>Consider briefly the case in which there is more than one entity
offering promise proposals. If a part of the federation serves two
masters (see department 3 in the figure below), i.e. it promises to
implement the wishes of two external sources, then those sources must
either agree one hundred percent in their proposals, or they must not
overlap at all. Since these `masters' may or may not be coordinated,
it is up to the federated entity (department 3) to make the decision
about which of the sources to obey.

The possiblity of conflict is easily handled in this architecture,
because it recognizes that the federated entity must be the final

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Global assurance</h3>

<p>The lack of a hierarchy has not made information chaotic and
disorganized.  It has only provided a simple means of
scalability and conflict resolution.

   <p>So what makes a federation different from a collection of completely
independent enterprises?  The answer to this question us usually
some minimum set of common promises that all parts of the federation
must keep: a baseline constitution.

   <p>Now, since the real power lies in the leaves of the organizational
tree, but the designated authority lies at the root, the root needs to
monitor the behaviour of the federated entities to ensure that this
baseline constition is being complied with.  This can be handled by
performing an audit of the whole federation according to a single
standard<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Merging and dividing enterprises</h3>

<p>Autonomy makes the merging and division of enterprise systems trivial. 
It is the way to enable out-sourcing and in-sourcing.

   <p>Imagine trying to combine two cups of coffee. Now try combining two
combine two buildings or houses of cards. Coffee mixes easily because
it is not full of dependencies (bonds) between its parts. Buildings
are not fluid: at best one can build bridges between them, and try to
build something else around them and then take them apart. The same
applies to any system, whether human, software or mechanical.

   <p>To merge two systems or enterprises, it will be much simpler if they
are fluid to begin with &ndash; i.e. they are basically composed of
autonomous parts, loosely coupled, not rigidly joined together. Hierarchical
organization is rigid, like a house of cards.  Service-oriented
systems are loosely coupled.  By keeping the internal organization of
systems as far as possible like independent service atoms, you
facilitate reorganization by merging and division.

<p>The fear that many traditionalists have of federated management is
that they cannot be certain of the outcome unless they have absolute
authority. This fear is misplaced however.  Certainty of outcome does
not depend on whether authority is federated or not: there are many
reasons why outcomes fail to be realized, including misunderstandings, accidents, force
majeur and simple disagreements.

   <p>Certain knowledge can only be obtained by observing the results
directly<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and repairing the
system if promises have not been kept. 
Trying to enforce rules and command from above is an expensive and
often ineffective way to manage systems, like swimming against the
current. Trust in the federated system reduces the cost of verifying
one's assumptions.

   <p>Hierarchies are sometimes used for oversight. Just as a conductor
takes care of the big picture for his orchestra, so managers in a
hierarchy can use their position to coordinate the larger picture for
their subordinates. However, like the orchestra, the manager should
not think that he has a real influence on the outcome. As long as each
player has the script and the instruments, the music can go on for
quite some time without its conductor. The role of a manager is one of
advice.

Rules of thumb for scalable management:

     <ul>
<li>Use autonomy to scale: proximity to the affected area
avoids unnecessary dependency and transport of materials. 
Trust costs less.

     <li>If you need to enforce a common baseline (or constitution) for all,
then arrange this as a service, not as a punitive force.  Use local
caching and the principal of convergence to a desired state
(idempotence) to provide assurance without the cost of monitoring.

     <li>Trust lowers costs.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The benefits of federated management</h3>

<p>Hierarchy is familiar, but not essential. A hierarchy is only a
so-called `spanning tree' for a more general network of relationships. 
It may be thought of as one possible point of view, amongst many &ndash;
one way of traversing a network of relationships.

   <p>A federated organization is automatically specialized into departments,
each of which knows its requirements best.

   <p>One could take an enterprise and divide it into
skill-areas or departments, then divide each department into
geopgraphical teams. Conversely, we could divide the enterprise by
country first and subdivide each country into regions, then divide
these into skills.  There is no unique way to traverse the
enterprise. In truth, it is not a hierarchy, but a network of
relationships.

   <p>If the federated teams or clusters in an enterprise have sufficient
autonomy, both in resources and intended authority, then they don't
need to communicate with or wait for other parts to do their jobs. 
Forcing that communication, due to lack of trust, will add overhead
and increase costs, without improving the certainty of outcome.

   <p>Promise Theory tells us that organization by autonomy automatically
indentifies the parts of a system that can operate independently &ndash;
i.e., the essential `atoms' of the system.  Thus, it is a method for
identifying the raw material building blocks from which everything
else can be built. Starting with these available raw materials, it
encourages a rational approach to design of systems that are efficient
and service oriented.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Think of an orchestra. The real expertise lies in the
players (below). The conductor (above) offers coordination and
guidance, but has no real power to create music. Music is possible
because each player has his/her own copy of the script, and can work
autonomously, with only a little guidance.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> At least we may assume this.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> Think, once again, about the orchestra. The
conductor observes the behaviour of each autonomous player to
determine whether the orchestra is playing together and is playing the
same piece of music.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> This is why society needs a police force to monitor
and respond to those who do not obey proposed law &ndash; whether they have
promised to or not. This is the role of Cfengine.</p>
