<h2 class="chapter">1 Communication Overview</h2>

<p>The idea of voluntary cooperation used by cfengine places restrictions
on how files can be copied between hosts.  Cfengine allows only `pull'
(download) but not `push' (upload). This means you cannot force a
cfagent to perform an operation against local policy but only request
resources. There is no loss of flexibility in this choice, but a big
increase in security.

   <p>Cfengine does not allow one to copy from one system to another system
(push) since it amounts to forcing the system to perform an operation
against it will. However, push is not totally eliminated from
cfengine. Cfengine supports a kind of push which consistent with the
idea of voluntary cooperation. If you want to copy from
your local system to a remote machine you will need to place an order
requesting the remote machine to copy the data for you. When the
remote machine receives the order it will evaluate itself to see if it
wants to handle the request. To allow remote copying between two systems each
of the system must explicitly grant access before the operation can
take place.

   <p>The following example illustrates how this could be done. We will
consider three scenarios namely client server communication, peer to
peer copying and simulation of push.

   <p>Example 1 set up the permission to allow a cfengine client to pull
data from a cfengine server. The domain specifies the existing
domain. The line 3 defines clients subnet. This means any client in
this subnet will be allowed to pull data from the server.  The next
step is to write the client policy files to copy data from the
server.

<p>Example 2 is the client policy file.

</pre>
   <p>Example 2 allows the client to copy or pull from the
/master/cfengine/inputs to /home/mark/inputs on the local
machine. This will succeed because the client is part of the subnet
allow to pull from the server. To test the setup we need to run
cfservd on the server side and cfagent on the client side.

<p>We consider the second scenario. For the second scenario we want both
machines to pull from each other. This means both machines should have
cfservd.conf files and also a policy files that pull the data from
each other. We will now label the systems peer1 and peer2. Suppose
peer 1 has ip 192.10.10.1 and peer 2 has an ip 192.10.10.2, we can
write the policy files as follows:

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Communication example 7</h4>

<p>We start by modifying the cfservd.conf file. We need to modify the
cfservd.conf to include the cfrun command. The cfrunCommand specifies
which cfengine agent should be run when cfrun request is received. The
cfservd.conf is modified as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     #cfservd.conf for the puller
     
     control:
     
      domain = ( mydomain.com )
      clients = ( 192.10.10 )   #peer subnet
      cfrunCommand = ( /var/cfengine/bin/cfagent )
      AllowConnectionsFrom = ( $(clients) ) #allow clients to pull data
      AllowMultipleConnectionsFrom = ( $(clients) )
      TrustKeysFrom = ( $(clients) )
     
     classes:
      hostlist = (  IPRange(192.10.10.0/24) )
     
     admit:
       /master/cfengine/inputs   $(clients)
       /var/cfengine/bin/cfagent  hostlist
     
</pre>
   <p>We include

<pre class="smallexample">     cfrunCommand = ( /var/cfengine/bin/cfagent )
</pre>
   <p>Here we specify that <code>cfagent</code> should be called when <code>cfrun</code> request is
received.  On the same server machine we have to write the pull
configuration file in the cfagent.conf since cfrunCommand reads
cfagent.conf by default.

to parse the policy file on all the hosts listed in cfrun.hosts
file. The cfrun.hosts file should be placed in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Authentication</h2>

<p>Authentication is about making sure you are who you say you
are. Traditionally, there are two main approaches: a trusted third
party (arbiter of the truth) approach and the challenge approach. The
trust third party allows us to use a third party that the two
individuals who want to authenticate each other trust to take the
decision, as usually done in e-commerce site. The challenge approach
allows the individuals to decide whether to trust each other rather
than using a third party. Cfengine uses the challenge approach. Its
model is based in the Secure Shell (OpenSSH). It allows two machines
to authenticate each other by the machine deciding whether to accept
the offered keys. For key exchange between client and server, the
server has to decide if it will trust the client by using the
TrustKeysFrom directive. The TrustKeysFrom directive allows the server
to accept keys from one or more machines.

   <p>On the client side the client has to also specify if it will trust key
from the server by using the trustkey directive. The trustkey
directive allows a client to decide whether to accept keys from a
server. The cfengine authentication model is base on ssh scheme,
however unlike ssh, cfengine authentication is not interactive and the
keys are generated by <code>cfkey</code> program instead of ssh key-gen
program. The ssh interaction is accomplished in cfengine using the
trustkey directive. Once the keys have been exchange the trustkey=on
is no longer effective. The cfkey when run generate the cfengine key
and store it in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys</span></samp> subdirectory.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Debugging tips</h2>

<p>Cfengine has debugging tools that help to troubleshooting. You can run
cfengine in debug mode by using the options dn where n range from
nothing to 2. So we have <samp><span class="option">-d0</span></samp>,<samp><span class="option">-d1</span></samp>,<samp><span class="option">-d2</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-d3</span></samp>. These options will generate outputs which enable one to
debug error in the policy file.  <samp><span class="option">-d1</span></samp> includes parsing
information but <samp><span class="option">d2</span></samp> does not include passing
information. <samp><span class="option">-d0</span></samp> means all debugging information and
<samp><span class="option">-d3</span></samp> is for summary parsing information.

   <p>Command example
<pre class="smallexample">     cfagent -d2
</pre>
   <p>When setting up cfservd, you might see the error message
<pre class="smallexample">     Apr 9 11:22:27 host.ex.org cfservd[613]: Host authentication failed or access denied
</pre>
   <p>This means that cfservd cannot or will not authenticate the connection
from your client machine. The message is generic. It is deliberately
non-specific so that anyone attempting to attack or exploit the
service will not be given information which might be useful to
them. There is a simple checklist for curing this problem:

     <ul>
<li>Make sure that the domain variable is set in both the cfagent.conf and cfservd.conf files. 
<li>Make sure that you have granted access to your client in the cfservd.conf file, e.g.

     <pre class="smallexample">                TrustKeysFrom = ( )
                AllowUsers = ( )
                AllowMultipleConnections = ( )
</pre>
     <li>Make sure you have created valid keys for the hosts using cfkey. 
<li>If you are using secure copy, make sure that you have created a key file and that you have distributed and installed it to all participating hosts in your cluster. 
</ul>

   <p>Remember that you can run both <code>cfagent</code> and <code>cfservd</code> in
debugging mode to see how the authentication takes place:

<pre class="smallexample">     cfagent -d2
     cfservd -d2
</pre>
   <p>Cfagent reports "access denied" regardless of the nature of the error,
to avoid giving away information which might be used by an
attacker. To find out the real reason for a denial, use debugging mode
<code>-d2</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Starting with cfrun</h2>

<p>To use <code>cfrun</code>, you start by creating a configuration file called
<samp><span class="file">cfrun.hosts</span></samp> in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp>.  In its simplest
form, it simply contains a list of host names (one per line) that are
to be contacted.  If there are special options that you would like to
set, globally or for a particular host, they can also be placed in the
file. For example, the domain name is needed if you are going to use
unqualified host names and your name resolution mechanism does not
append a default domain.

   <p>Here is an example file:
<pre class="smallexample">     domain=cfengine.org
     access=mark,aeleen
     outputdir=/tmp/cfoutput
     maxchild=20
     hostnamekeys=true
     
     gudinne
     wallace:3333
     ...
     include=cfrun.external.hosts
</pre>
   <p>Here, we define a list of allowed users, a directory for placing the output of <code>cfrun</code> queries,
a maximum number of children to spawn
for parallel connections, and required that hosts use key-based authentication. We also list two hosts (one
with an alternate communication port),
as well as including an external file listing more.

   <p>If the <code>outputdir</code> directive is in place, cfrun automatically uses a
parallelized batch method of communication.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Using the cfrun command</h3>

<p>The <code>cfrun</code> command itself has the following form:
<pre class="smallexample">     cfrun - <var>local options</var> [<var>host list</var>] -- <var>remote options</var> -- <var>remote classes</var>
</pre>
   <p>If not host list is included, then all of the hosts in <samp><span class="file">cfrun.hosts</span></samp> are contacted.

   <p>Since <code>cfrun</code> addresses remote hosts from a local host, there is
an ambiguity in whether options are intended for the <code>cfrun</code>
command itself, or whether they are meant to be passed on to the agent
on the remote hosts.  To clarify this distinction, the arguments are
organized as follows:

     <ul>
<li>Local options are processed by <code>cfrun</code> on the local host. 
<li>Remote options
are passed on as options to the remote <code>cfagent</code> (actually to the
command defined in <code>cfrunCommand</code>. Note, however, that it is not
possible to send the <code>-f</code> option to the remote agent, to ask it
to run a different policy file. This option is stripped by the server
on receipt to prevent an unauthorized attempt to change policy. 
<li>Remote classes are processed by the remote <code>cfservd</code> service, and specify
classes which must be satisfied by the remote host in order to invoke the
remote command. 
</ul>

   <p>Here are some examples, all of which use the host list in <samp><span class="file">cfrun.hosts</span></samp>:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cfrun -- -- linux</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Run on all machines, specifying class linux.

<h3 class="section">5.2 DHCP and Dynamic Addresses</h3>

<p>If you are using dynamic addressing for hosts, cfengine will struggle
to justify its trust in the public keys it sees. To make sense of
public keys one requires both a key and an independent identity to tie
it to. Once a key has been trusted, the key alone is (in principle)
sufficient identity (just as a fingerprint is good enough to represent
you, once it has been registered).

   <p>When IP addresses change, <code>cfservd</code> loses its coupling between address
and key identity and so it has to start re-evaluating. There are two cases
to consider, and the default behavior is like this:

     <ul>
<li>A host with a known IP address presents a new key to <code>cfservd</code>, because for instance
the key was changed. In this case cfservd complains that the keys do not match
and refuses to authenticate you. 
2item A host with an unknown IP address but a known key. In this case,
cfengine will look for a key file bound to the new address and will
not find one, so cfservd treats the key as unknown and normal trust
rules for accepting a new key apply. 
</ul>

   <p>This can cause a problem for hosts with IPV4 addresses given by DHCP,
since the address-key binding is only temporary. <code>cfservd</code> works around this by allowing you do define
a new access list called
<pre class="smallexample">     DynamicAddresses = ( 192.240.1 )
</pre>
   <p>If a connecting address is unknown, but lies in this range, cfservd
will look in a database to see if the key itself is known, bound to a
different address. If the key is found, <code>cfservd</code> trusts the
binding and re-binds the key to the new IP address. If the key is not
known, then (again) normal trust rules apply for accepting a new key.

   <p>Servers should always have fixed IP addresses in general, otherwise
you have no idea to whom you are connecting.

<h3 class="section">5.3 Public Key Exchange Issues</h3>

<p>Public key exchange is a subtle idea. The issues are not difficult
to understand, but they are seldom expressed very clearly.

   <p>The principle of a public key system is to associate an identity with
a key, which can be freely made public knowledge. The difficulty is
not in distributing the key, but in being certain who is really
the owner of a key that you have received.

   <p>Imagine you wanted to know the identity of a stranger whom you have
never seen before. What proof would you accept of his or her
identity?  A name tag? A letter of reference? A DNA test? Of course,
an evil identical twin would be able to pass all of these tests and
still fool you.

   <p>It is important to understand that trust in identity is something we always
grant in an entirely personal way. There is always a chance of being
wrong: cryptographic methods do not eliminate this doubt (although they
sometimes are presented as doing so). Trust is risk, and you simply
have to live with it.

   <p>There are two common models of trust management:

     <ul>
<li>The trusted third party: This method is used by the Web. 
Here you outsource the trust decision to a third party who claims to
know whether keys are genuine. This
provides a centralized management of trust. Since cfengine is
about decentralization, this method is not used by cfengine.

     <li>The challenge: Individual decision making is the way to
make trust decisions for autonomous agents. They want to rely only
on their own judgment. The secure shell uses this approach. Instead
of asking yout to trust an authority/third party, the software requires
you to assume the risk and you must decide whether to accept offered keys. 
</ul>

   <p>Key exchange in cfengine is very similar to that in the secure shell. However, cfengine uses separate keys
from <code>ssh</code> that are generated using
the <code>cfkey</code> program.

   <p>Cfagent is not an interactive program, so when it
first receives a key, the decision as to whether to accept it must be
made non-interactively. 
The natural solution is to make this decision part of policy. 
There are two methods for accomplishing this:

     <ul>
<li>Client side: You can add <code>trustkey=on</code> to a remote copy
command to accept the named remote-server's key. 
<li>Server side: The server can receive keys from many sources; the access
control list for this is the <code>TrustKeysFrom</code> directive. If a server IP address is in
this list, it will be accepted. 
</ul>

   <p>Once a key has been accepted on
trust, it is trusted for ever, or until you revoke the key by
explicitly deleting the key from <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys</span></samp>. 
So once the key has been exchanged, the <code>trustkey</code> option has no effect. 
Thus, on the client side it does not matter if you leave
<code>trustkey</code> options in place. On the server side, however, remember
that the trust rule applies to many hosts, some of which
you might not have considered. Always take care with trust issues.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Security Implications of using cfengine</h2>

<p>Though the actual security implication of using cfengine is minimal we
still need to be aware of possible risk and how we can protect
ourselves. Cfengine uses autonomous agents which are complete on their
own. Each agent manages it check sum database without the support of
external server. This means if someone tampers with the database he
could breach cfengine security.  One of the solutions to this is to
keep cfengine database at a secure location on the system or take a
backup of the database.

   <p>We could also use neighborhood watch approach where databases of
agents are distributed to the neighbors which can then be compared to
the original agent’s database for consistency.

   <p>Cfengine depends on the policy configuration file for its
operations. If this file is changed by an attacker, cfengine will
implement the policy of the attacker. It is therefore important to
ensure that cfengine configuration file is secured.  Cfengine also
runs with open port 5308 and therefore it is important to protect the
port from external attack.  It may be advisable to block external
access to the port.

   <p>Cfengine authentication depends on public and private key pairs. The
cfengine public keys transfer can be done implicitly or explicitly. It
is important to ensure accountable key distribution.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Security of pulling files</h3>

     <ul>
<li><i> Doesn't opening a port on a machine on the inside of the firewall make
it vulnerable to both Denial of Service and buffer overflow attacks?</i>

     <p>Buffer overflow attacks are extremely unlikely in cfengine by
design. The likelihood of a bug in cfengine should be compared to the
likelihood of a bug existing in the firewall itself.

     <p>Denial of service attacks can be mitigated by careful configuration
(see separate FAQ item). <code>cfservd</code> reads a fixed number of bytes
from the input stream before deciding whether to drop a connection
from a remote host, so it is not possible to buffer overflow attack
before rejection of an invalid host IP.

     <p>Another possibility is to use a standard VPN to the inside of the
firewall. That way one is concerned first and foremost with the
vulnerabilities of the VPN software. Doesn't opening the firewall
compromise the integrity of the policy information by allowing an
attacker the chance to alter it? The cfengine security model, as well
as the design of the server, disallows the uploading of
information. No message sent over the cfengine channel can alter data
on the server. (This assumes that buffer overflows are impossible.)

     <li><i> Couldn't an IP spoofer manage to gain access to data from the policy
server that it should not be able to access?</i>

     <p>Assuming that buffer overflow attacks and DOS attacks are highly
improbable, the main worry with opening a port is that intruders will
be able to gain access to unauthorized data. If the firewall is
configured to open only connections from the policy mirror, then an
attacker must spoof the IP of the policy attacker. This requires
access to another host in the DMZ and is non-trivial. However, suppose
the attacker succeeds then the worst he/she can do is to download
information that is available to the policy-mirror. But that
information is already available in the DMZ since the data have been
exported as part of the policy, thus there is no breach of
security. (Security must be understood to be a breach of the terms of
policy that has been decided.)

     <li><i> What happens if the policy mirror is invaded by an attacker?</i>

     <p>If an attacker gains root access to the mirror, he/she will be able to
affect the policy distributed to any host in the DMZ. The
policy-mirror has no access to alter any information on the policy
source host. Note that this is consistent with the firewall security
model of trusted/untrusted regions. The firewall does not mitigate the
responsibility of security every host in a network regardless of which
side of the firewall it is connected.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Cfengine and Firewalls</h3>

<p>Some users want to use cfengine's remote copying mechanism through a
firewall, in particular to update the cfengine policy on hosts inside
a DMZ (so-called de-militarized zone). Firewalls are often shrouded in
myth and mystery. It is important to see the firewall security model
together with the cfengine security model. Amongst the difficulties
one faces, the firewall administrator is not often the same as the
cfengine administrator and does not trust anyone or anything. You
might have to convince this person to make changes that help you out,
so it is important to understand the consequences of your security
strategy.

   <p>Any piece of software that traverses a firewall can, in principle,
weaken the security of the barrier. On the other hand, a strong piece
or software might have better security than the firewall
itself. Consider the example in the figure;

   <div class="block-image"><img src="firewall.png" alt="A cfengine host outside a firewall"></div>

   <p>We label the regions inside and outside of the firewall as the &ldquo;secure
area" and &ldquo;Demilitarized Zone" for convenience. It should be
understood that the areas inside a firewall is not necessarily secure
in any sense of the word unless the firewall configuration is
understood together with all other security measures.

   <p>Our problem is to copy files from the &ldquo;secure&rdquo; source machine to hosts
in the DMZ, in order to send them their configuration policy
updates. There are two ways of getting files through the firewall:

     <ul>
<li>An automated cfengine solution, i.e., pull from outside to inside the secure area. 
<li>A manual push to the outside of the wall from the inside. 
</ul>

   <p>One of the
main aims of a firewall is to prevent hosts outside the secure area
from opening connections to hosts in the secure area. If we want
<code>cfagent</code> processes on the outside of the firewall to receive updated policies
from the inside of the firewall, information has to traverse the
firewall.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.1 Cfengine trust model</h4>

<p>Cfengine's trust model is fundamentally at odds with the external
firewall concept. Cfengine says: &ldquo;I am my own boss. I don't trust
anyone to push me data.&rdquo; The firewall says: &ldquo;I only trust things
that are behind me.&rdquo;  The firewall thinks it is being secure if it
pushes data from behind itself to the DMZ. Cfengine thinks it is being
secure if it makes the decision to pull the data autonomously, without
any orders from some potentially unknown machine. One of these
mechanisms has to give if firewalls are to co-exist with cfengine.

   <p>From the firewall's viewpoint, push and pull are different: a push
requires only an outgoing connection from a trusted source to an
untrusted destination; a pull necessarily requires an untrusted
connection being opened to a trusted server within the secure area. 
For some firewall administrators, the latter is simply unacceptable
(because they are conditioned to trust their firewall). But it is
important to evaluate the actual risk. We have a few observations
about the latter to offer at this point:

     <ul>
<li>It is not the aim of this note to advocate any one method of
update. You must decide for yourself. The aim here is only to evaluate
the security implications. Exporting data from the secure area to the
DMZ automatically downgrades the privacy of the information. 
<li>The cfengine security model assumes that the security of every host
will be taken seriously. A firewall should never be used as a
substitute for host security. 
<li>Knowing about cfengine but not your firewall or your secure network, it is only possible
to say here that it seems, to us, safe to open a hole in a firewall to
download data from a host of our choice, but we would not accept data
from just any host on your company network on trust. It would be
ludicrous to suggest that an arbitrary employee's machine is more
secure than an inaccessible host in the DMZ.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.2 Policy Mirror in the DMZ</h4>

<p>You can compromise by creating a policy mirror in the DMZ. This is
the recommended way to copy files, so that normal cfengine pull
methods can then be used by all other hosts in the DMZ, using the
mirror as their source. The policy mirror host should be as secure as
possible, with preferably few or no other services running that might
allow an attacker to compromise it. In this configuration, you are
using the mirror host as an envoi of the secure region in the DMZ.

   <p>Any method of pushing a new version of policy can be chosen in
principle: CVS, FTP, RSYNC, SCP. The security disadvantage of the push
method is that it opens a port on the policy-mirror, and therefore the
same vulnerability is now present on the mirror, except that now you
have to trust the security of another piece of software too. Since
this is not a cfengine port, no guarantees can be made about what
access attackers will get to the mirror host.

<h4 class="subsection">6.2.3 Pulling through a wormhole</h4>

<p>Suppose you are allowed to open a hole in your firewall to a single
policy host on the inside.  To distribute files to hosts that are
outside the firewall it is only necessary to open a single tunnel
through the firewall from the policy-mirror to the cfengine service
port on the source machine. Connections from any other host will still
be denied by the firewall. This minimizes the risk of any problems
caused by attackers.

   <p>To open a tunnel through the firewall, you need to alter
the filter rules. A firewall blocks access at the network
level. Configuring the opening of a single port is
straightforward. We present some sample rules below, but make sure
you seek the guidance of an expert if necessary.

   <p>Cisco IOS rules look like this
<pre class="smallexample">     ip access-group 100 in
     access-list     100 permit tcp mirror host source eq 5308
     access-list     100 deny   ip  any any
</pre>
   <p>Linux <code>iptables</code> rules might look something like this:
<pre class="smallexample">     iptables -N newchain
     iptables -A newchain -p tcp -s mirror-ip 5308 -j ACCEPT
     iptables -A newchain -j DENY
</pre>
   <p>Once a new copy of the policy is downloaded by cfengine to the policy
mirror, other clients in the DMZ can download that copy from the
mirror. The security of other hosts in the DMZ is dependent on the
security of the policy mirror.

<p>Cfengine can be centralized or decentralized depending on the
requirement and the choice of the user. The centralized infrastructure
consists of policy server which will store the policy configuration
files for distribution; the rest of the hosts will pull their policy
from this centralized server. The merit of centralized administration
are that it aids consistency by providing single point of decision
making, change of policy is easy since it is done at one place, backup
and version control are also convenient.  However, centralized
administration could hinder local customization; it is inappropriate
for privacy and security if we have completely independent departments
or services which needs to coexist and work together.

<h3 class="section">6.4 Tamperproof data and distributed monitoring</h3>

<p>Message digests are supposed to be unbreakable, tamperproof
technologies, but of course everything can be broken by a sufficiently
determined attacker. Suppose someone wanted to edit a file and alter
the cfengine checksum database to cover their tracks. If they had
broken into your system, this is potentially easy to do. How can we
detect whether this has happened or not?

   <p>A simple solution to this problem is to use another checksum-based
operation to copy the database to a completely different host. By using
a copy operation based on a checksum value, we can also remotely detect
a change in the checksum database itself.

   <p>Consider the following code:

<pre class="smallexample">     # Neighbourhood watch
     
     control:
     
       allpeers = (
                  SelectPartitionNeighbours(/path/hostlist,#,random,4)
                  )
     
     copy:
     
           /var/cfengine/checksum_digests.db
     
                             dest=/safekeep/chkdb_$(this)
                             type=checksum
                             server=$(allpeers)
                             inform=true          # warn of copy
                             backup=timestamp
                             define=tampering
     
     alert:
     
       tampering::
     
            'Digest tampering detected on a peer'
     
</pre>
   <p>It works by building a list of neighbours for each host. The function SelectPartitionNeighbours

   <p>can be used for this. Using a file which
contains a list of all hosts running cfengine (e.g. the
cfrun.hosts file),
we create a list of hosts to copy databases . Each host in the
network therefore takes on the responsibility to watch over its
neighbours.

   <p>The copy rule attempts to copy the database to some file in a
safekeeping directory. We label the destination file with $(this)
which becomes the name of the server from which the file was
collected. Finally, we backup any successful copies using a timestamp
to retain a complete record of all changes on the remote host. Each
time a change is detected, a copy will be kept of the old. The rule
contains triggers to issue alerts and warnings too just to make sure
the message will be heard.

   <p>In theory, all four neighbours should signal this change. If an
attacker had detailed knowledge of the system, he or she might be able
to subvert one or two of these before the change was detected, but it
is unlikely that all four could be covered up. At any rate, this
approach maximizes the chances of change detection.

   <p>Finally, in order to make this copy, you must, of course, grant access
to the database in cfservd.conf.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     # cfservd.conf
     
     admit:
     
     any::
     
        /var/cfengine/checksum_digests.db  mydomain.tld
     
</pre>
   <p>Let us now consider what happens if an attacker changes a file an
edits the checksum database. Each of the four hosts that has been
designated a neighbour will attempt to update their own copy of the
database. If the database has been tampered with, they will detect a
change in the md5 checksums of the remote copy versus the
original. The file will therefore be copied.

   <p>It is not a big problem that others have a copy of your checksum
database.  They cannot see the contents of your files from this.  A
possibly greater problem is that this configuration will unleash an
avalanche of messages if a change is detected. This makes messages
visible at least.
