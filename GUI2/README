Required PHP modules
---------------------------------
1) mongo
2) mcrypt
3) curl
4) phpsvn module ver 1.6.6
5) cfmod



Apache configuration
---------------------------------

*) Copy Apache-htaccess to DOCROOT/.htaccess (e.g. /var/www/.htaccess on Ubuntu)
*) apache directive AllowEncodedSlashes On should be present (MUST)
*) Make sure AllowOverride is set to All for this directory in main apache config.
e.g. on Ubuntu /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default, 
  ---
  ...
       <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
  ...
  --- 

You may instead incorporate the Apache-htaccess file into your main Apache configuration.


Creating inital user
---------------------------------

To create a admin/admin user, point your browser to
http://localhost/testing/mongodbinput on the hub  ...only for development

For production we have to do mongorestore of the directory name "phpcfenginenova" with in the package
./mongorestore -d phpcfengine phpcfenginenova

default username:admin     password:admin

after creating restoring the database from dumpfiles inside phpcfenginenova we can remove the directory phpcfenginenova directory


There should also be a policies directories inside the www root folder of application where it can make  the working directory for various users.
Also we need directory named temp to make temporary storage to do a pdf calculation and emailing that pdf file.


Email send By the system
------------------------------------
The default email address used by the System to send emails is
admin@cfengine.com
It can be changed by editing file name under application/config/ion_auth.php line containing
$config['admin_email']		   = "admin@cfengine.com";


EnvironmentConfiguration
------------------------------------
The Default environment is Developement which will show all kinds of php errors to the user
if it is set to "Production" then errors are logged in apache log as well as in mongo db collection bt in this release it
the logs in mongo are  not viewable as there are no viewere to display it.
Environment can be changed by editing the file named index.php in application root with line

define('ENVIRONMENT', 'development');
