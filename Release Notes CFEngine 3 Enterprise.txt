CHANGE LOG FROM 2.2.x:
* Redesign of Mission Portal
   - New visual appearance
   - New navigation concepts with shorter paths to different views
   - Rooms renamed to Apps
   - New Apps with additional functionality (see below)
* New Functionality in Mission Portal
   - SQL Reporting App: Build customizable reports through SQL queries. Schedule reports to send by email.
   - Hosts App: Ability to select policy context for graphs and reports. Choose between viewing data from All, User or System (CFEngine internal) promises.
   - Services App: Browse current host capacity providing services in your environment
   - Policies App: Show the promises that the system is currently trying to keep
   - Goals App: Connect promises to high level organizational goals and key performance indicators
   - Compliance App: Overview of the current state and history of compliance across your system, through the lens of different compliance standards
* Redesign of default policy schema, see separate section below.
* REST API v2
* Support for collecting reports from hosts behind a NAT boundary/inside a DMZ
* New classes enterprise: enterprise_X, enterprise_X_Y, enterprise_X_Y_Z on CFEngine Enterprise, to reflect the version running. 
* New variable sys.enterprise_version that holds the CFEngine Enterprise version. This complements the Nova classes and the sys.nova_version variable, which will eventually be deprecated.
* Created a variable update_policy.mongodb_dir, for cases where MongoDB should not run out of /var/cfengine/state (could grow to tens of gigabytes).
* Removed commercial_customer class, as it was unused in internal policies. Please use enterprise_edition instead if you used this in your policies.
* New performance report events: DBPurgeHostsAll, DBMaintenance, DBMaintenanceTimestampsSingleHost, DBCacheCompliance, DBReportCollectAll.
* License verification is made more robust by not relying on the last-seen database anymore. This means you do not need to bootstrap a client to verify the license. See the cf-key --install-license option.
* Pagination of user list, search users.
* ...


NEW DEFAULT POLICY SCHEMA:
* promises.cf now only contains the body common control (with the bundle sequence and input file list) and an example agent bundle. All other parts of policy have moved into separate subdirectories (see below).
* New directory structure:
   - cfe_internal/: CFEngine specific policies that ensure system integrity and example policy for visualizing goals in the Mission Portal
   - failsafe/: Houses the main failsafe that will be run before each execution of promises.cf (to check for policy and binary updates).
   - controls/: Contains the control bodies for all CFEngine agents
   - services/: Example policy for file watch
* failsafe.cf in /var/cfengine/inputs/ represents a hard coded backup of /var/cfengine/inputs/failsafe/failsafe.cf. NEVER CHANGE THIS FILE, it is there to avoid that policy updates will not be fetched if the user breaks the /var/cfengine/inputs/failsafe/failsafe.cf policy (which would require manually logging in to each affected node to fix).


BUGFIXES SINCE 2.2.x (TODO):
* ...

INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE:
See separate INSTALL file for instructions.


KNOWN ISSUES (TODO):
* While using CFEngine's packages promises with package managers (such as: yum/apt etc.), please make sure that valid package names are supplied. Currently there is a problem with evaluating the return codes of the package managers when the package name doesn't exist in the repository. This will eventually result in cf-hub not collecting software reports even if some valid packages are installed/removed/modified.
* Policy context selection will not work unless the 
* Verbose output in command line interface (CLI) still indicates that you are using CFEngine 3 Nova (i.e. the CLI prefixes the verbose output with "nova> [MESSAGE]". See message for next release below.
* A change in hub maintenance process interval from the default 6 hours will effect the time series graph on the Engineering page (may have blanks or other display problems).


IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR NEXT MAJOR RELEASE (CFENGINE 3 ENTERPRISE 3.0):
CFEngine will change the behavior of the command line interface verbose output from "nova> [MESSAGE]" to "enterprise [MESSAGE]" for the next version of CFEngine 3 Enterprise. Please make necessary preparations for this as to not break functionality that depends on these messages (email filters, post-processing scripts, etc.).
