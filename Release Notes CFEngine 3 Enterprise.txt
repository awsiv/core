CHANGE LOG FROM 2.1.3:
* Introduction of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to Mission Portal
* REST API giving read access to most reporting data available in the Mission Portal
* Redesign of Engineering Room
    - Host Navigation Tree which allows grouping of hosts, which in turn influences the content on the remainder of the page.
    - Tabulated Status and Reports section
    - Simplified Status Summary graph, now only shows promise compliance for selected hosts
    - Removal of Report finders, functionality switched to drop-down menus found in Reports tab
    - Reports open in a new web browser tab
    - New Bundle Compliance Summary Report which classifies hosts into red/yellow/green/blue/black groups according to bundle compliance
    - New Promise Compliance Summary Report which classifies hosts into red/yellow/green/blue/black groups according to promise compliance
* Advanced class context filter allowing includes and excludes regular expressions
* Export reports to CSV from Mission Portal
* Ability to configure the time horizon for which a host is classified as blue (has not connected to hub)
* New host category: black (hosts that failed to execute their agents for the last three scheduled rounds)
* Ability to delete multiple hosts from the mission portal (NOTE: it's in the roadmap, but didn't we have this feature in 2.1.3 already?)
* Knowledge Map enhancements to increase usability and ease of use
* More diagnostics on report collection from cf-hub. 
    - Logging more useful information in cf-hub -l
    - Measuring total collection time in benchmarks report, under id "ReportCollectAll".
* Reduced amount of connections from cf-hub to localhost mongodb (now there is one connection per cf-hub run (max 50), before it was three per client).
* Software and variable report now contains end-node discovery time.
* Software and patches available/status reports contain maximum 5-minute old data, improved from 6 hours in last release.
* Software report query from Mission Portal is much faster on larger data-sets due to removal of autocomplete feature.
* Upgraded mongod from version 1.8.2 to 2.0.4, which increases efficiency on concurrency and reduces memory usage.
* New function hostswithclass() that generates a list of hosts in a given class on the hub.
* The bundled failsafe.cf policy now has trustkey=false to avoid IP spoofing attacks in default policy

* TODO: Other changes to default policies?


BUGFIXES SINCE 2.1.3:
* Fixed issue where client would show as green in the Mission Portal when no data was received, e.g. due to access or license error at client. Now correctly shows as blue in these cases.
MORE TODO?

See https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php for change log related to the CFEngine Community Core (versions 3.2.4 to 3.3.1).


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES (specific to CFEngine 3 Enterprise)
* Clean install is tested, upgrade from previous version of NOVA tested (Note: TBD).
* As always, install HUB first, then client(s).
* For large systems (> 1000 hosts) we recommend increasing the memory limit in php.conf on the HUB (for instance to 128 MB)
* REFER TO INSTALLATION.TXT for (Note: TODO) detailed instructions.


UPGRADE PROCEDURE:
TODO

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Software and patches available/status reports containing maximum 5-minute old data: will only apply to clients that are upgraded to 2.2.0.
Question: Problems with compatibility of bundle/promise compliance between new and older clients (reports)?
TODO?
