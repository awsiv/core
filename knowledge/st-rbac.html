<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is Role Based Access Control?</h3>

<p>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) describes a set of promises made by a host
to grant privileged access to the system.  In this regard, RBAC is no
different from any other form of access control, however, it is
normally used to grant the privilege to execute certain commands that
make changes to the system &ndash; thus it involves <i>write</i> or <i>change</i>
privilege.

   <p>The term <i>role</i>-based is used because users are often classified
into managerial roles that are each assigned different levels of privilege
with regard to the kind of tasks they need to perform.

   <p>Role Based Access Control is used when remote users request access to
a privileged service from some kind of service-agent running on a host. 
For example, the password on the Unix root account is a simple RBAC system where
access is granted to execute any command with unlimited privilege, to
any user who knows the root password.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The risks of RBAC</h3>

<p>Granting privilege to execute commands has obvious risks. The
implementation of restricted access is usually handled in one of a
number of different ways.  The term RBAC does not explain, in itself,
which of these models will be used.

   <p>Two common alternatives may be distinguished:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Arbitrary commands may be executed by privileged individuals (trusted user model).</i><dd>
This is a high risk privilege granting system, where arbitrary change privileges are granted to
users.

     <br><dt><i>Pre-defined privileged operations may be made accessible to certain individuals/roles (Clark-Wilson model).</i><dd>
This is a lower risk system, where users are only allowed privilege while executing very specific
pre-defined activities (e.g. the right to initiate a backup).

   </dl>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">CFEngine's approach to privilege</h3>

<p>CFEngine handles privileged access somewhat differently. To see why, it is important
to understand what CFEngine is not:
     <ul>
<li>CFEngine is not a service agent that grants remote change access to systems. 
<li>CFEngine is not a remote-control for system operations<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
</ul>
   CFEngine is intended for autonomous hands-free operation, and thus the
issue of remote access almost never arises directly. 
In CFEngine it is expressly forbidden for a
part of CFEngine to receive commands from external parties. In a
limited sense, CFEngine can be configured to listen for requests for
classes that label the context for extraordinary, predefined
policies; these can then be activated by certain users (<code>roles</code>
promises), providing a version of the second form of RBAC above. We shall return to this
below.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
By design it is not possible to send instructions to CFEngine that have
not been pre-approved by the host administrator and promised as
policy. Ultimately the local host administrator can veto any proposals
for change in any configuration system (e.g. by unplugging the network).

   <p>In CFEngine this is made a central tenet of the management model. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>From a security perspective, the elimination of remote command access
presents a huge simplification to security, without loss of
functionality. The risk of executing privileged commands on the system is
exchanged for a right to submit policy changes. Thus the access control
becomes a matter of <i>who is allowed to approve policy for dissemination</i> to the system.

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The chain of privilege in CFEngine</h3>

<p>Even though CFEngine is not in the business of granting privilege for command execution, there
are security implications to using CFEngine and thus we should
examine the chain of influence from user to host to understand the implications.

   <p>In normal usage, users work as follows:

     <ul>
<li>A user edits a CFEngine input file. 
<li>The input file determines a promise proposal, or template for policy. 
<li>Someone publishes the policy for dissemination to interested parties. 
<li>Interested parties (hosts running CFEngine) may choose to download these new propsals
from trusted sources. These sources are defined in the existing policy which may always
be vetoed by a local administrator.

     <li>CFEngine will execute the new policies with the maximum privilege granted to it. 
This privilege can be altered:
          <ul>
<li>By virtue of the privilege with the CFEngine itself runs. 
<li>By the privilege accorded to a promise as a matter of its own policy. 
</ul>
     </ul>
   When planning for the security of system changes, one should assume that any promise
written in a CFEngine policy will be enforced with maximum privilege.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The role of centralized push and pull in RBAC</h3>

<p>Centralization is a strategy of collecting resources into a single location. A central resource
often becomes authoritative for a collection of hosts. Centralization has
positive and negative aspects

     <ul>
<li>As a single point of direction, it simplifies the coordination of multiple agents (like a conductor in an orchestra). 
<li>It can be a single point of failure, and a bottleneck for operations. Becauses centralization concentrates effort,
brute force must be used by a hub when scaling to many hosts around a centralized strategy. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In terms of privilege, the implications of centralization are significantly
different for <i>push</i> and <i>pull</i> based systems (see the figures below). 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Let us first consider the general problem, without reference to CFEngine.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="central_push.png" alt="central_push.png"></div>
<div align="center">Pushing out requires distributed RBAC control (read/write).</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
A <i>push</i> is defined to be either
     <ul>
<li>The involuntary transmission of data to hosts
from a hub, or
<li>The remote execution of commands from the hub to the hosts. 
</ul>
   We see easily from the figures below that configuration of adequate access control
requires access control configuration to be implemented on every managed host. 
If the hosts require different levels of access in different zones, for instance,
this requires a distributed configuration control of the RBAC system itself across
the affected hosts. There is thus a burden to setting up RBAC.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
One configures a system for a <i>push</i>
system just as one configures a system against attack from outside. In configuration
terms, push is indistinguishable from an attack. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>Pull-based management is fundamentally different. In a pull model, hosts
download public information (their policy) from a trusted source.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="central_pull.png" alt="central_pull.png"></div>
<div align="center">Pulling updates requires only centralized RBAC control for change,</div>
<div align="center">but not for the update itself (read only).</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
There is no need for access control on the hosts anymore, since they
are only reading information voluntarily. They may simply reject all attempts
to send them data, in favour of their voluntary decision to download
updates.

   <p>Moving from push to pull-based configuration simplifies the number
of independent points of configuration from N to 1, and the location
of access control information is simplified from N separate models
to a single model at the hub. The hub can decide which hosts
will have access to which policy proposals, so there is no loss
of privacy: the security model's definition is fully centralized (single point of definition for consistency).

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <ul>
<li>Push-based approaches have centralized execution, but distributed RBAC configuration of the management setting. 
Multiple, inconsistent pushes from different hubs can even lead to distributed inconsistency that cannot be detected from
any single location.

     <li>Pull-based approaches have distributed execution, but a single point of security configuration. 
Inconsistent pulls are impossible, as there is a single point of definition. 
</ul>
   </td></tr></table>
   At CFEngine, we strongly believe that pull-based systems are superior
for most purposes, because pull's distributed operation reduces the
risk of the bottleneck, while the centralized definition of access
rights reduces the risk of error.

   <p>In all further sections, we assume CFEngine's pull-based model.

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">No need for any centralization in CFEngine</h3>

<p>Before continuing, it is important to emphasize that CFEngine has no
technological <i>need</i> for centralization. The decision to centralize
management is a policy decision. Every host can, if desired, be configured as an
independent device, with its own policy, making no contact with any
external host. CFEngine is thus ideal for embedded systems and
environments with partial connectivity, such as ships and submarines. 
Nevertheless, centralized management is often chosen for its simple
coordination of decision making. What is important to realize is that
centralized decision-making is a convenient fiction for managers &ndash;
no remote party can truly decide the state of a host.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The owner of a machine always has the privilege to make changes to it. 
Push-based models of management that pretend to control hosts absolutely
are simply misleading, as they exist by the good grace of end systems. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>In the remainder of this Special Topics Guide, we shall assume the
common model of centralized management, because that is the
context in which RBAC is relevant.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The risk from centralized trusted hosts</h3>

<p>Centralization has implications for risk<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  Gaining malicious control of a trusted source could have a
significant impact on all the hosts that subscribe to updates from it.

   <p>The risk, in this case, is precisely the same as that for a push-based system that executes
certain commands.  However, the task of defending a single trusted
host is (at least psychologically) simpler than that of defending all
the hosts in the network<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

   <p>The risk of propagating a bad change (i.e. an unfortunate mistake) is also no
different between push and pull.  A bad decision is simply a bad
decision. The antidote to human errors is to conduct policy reviews, i.e. use
more pairs of eyes, or `dual-key' solutions.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Centralize the writing of policy, within a local region to obtain
straightforward consistency. Don't overcentralize, or you will oversimplfy.

have the right to edit and publish changes to policy?

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The Policy Dispatch Point</h3>

<p>The burden of security is now localized entirely at the Policy Dispatch Point. 
It becomes the responsibility of this `role' (policy dispatcher) to ensure
that the desired state is in fact the one that is promised. This happens
in two practical steps:

     <ul>
<li>Editing of an SVN repository of working proposals (access to change respository). 
<li>Merging of changes into the actual published policy (bowtie process). 
</ul>

   <p>Where the highest levels of paranoia are justified, no host should
receive automatic updates of policy without explicit human inspection
and policy review. This is equivalent to allowing no RBAC privileges.

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The right to edit and publish policy</h3>

<p>Let's recap' for a moment.  The CFEngine agent runs with maximum
system privilege (root/Administrator), and makes its decisions based
on a set of promise proposals that come from some trusted source,
e.g. the owner of the machine, or some central policy decision point. 
Once a set of proposals has been published, we simply call these `the policy'.  The agent on
each host reads these proposals and picks out those that are relevant
to the current context (`here and now') for each host. The agent then
tries to keep these promises, by making any necessary changes to the
system. For most common usages of CFEngine, the effect is that
anything that is in the published policy is executed with up to
maximum privilege.

   <p>This means the following:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Any user who can edit the actual source policy has control over a host.</i><dd>
The policy should not be writable by any unauthorized user, in any location
where it will be picked up as part of the policy-appoved process for updating
policy<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

     <br><dt><i>Any user who can cause a new version of the policy to be published for immediate use has privileged access.</i><dd>
RBAC now means limiting access to the files that define policy.

     <br><dt><i>If policy is automatically checked out of a repository, commit access to the respository can give privileged access.</i><dd>
There should be a process of approval for changes made to policy. This should  be a human
process, because ultimately a human must be responsible for publishing a policy. In this situation, RBAC now
consists of granting access to make commits to the repository.

   </dl>

   <p>The conclusion of this section is that only a small number of highly trusted individuals
should be able to alter policy themselves.

   <p>Distributed coordination. RBAC is a poor tool for delegating tasks alone, because if multiple
individuals with access rights are not coordinated in their promises, the result will merely be
a conflict.

</div>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The bowtie process</h3>

<p>Promise theory allows us to model the collaborative security
implications of this (see the figure of the bow-tie structure). A
simple method of delegating is the following.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Delegate responsibility for different issues to admin teams 1,2,3, etc. 
<li>Make each of these teams responsible for version control of their own
configuration rules. 
<li>Make an intermediate agent responsible for collating and vetting the rules, checking for
irregularities and conflicts. This agent must promise to disallow rules by
one team that are the responsibility of another team. The agent could be a
layer of software, but a cheaper and more manageable solution is the make this
another group of one or more humans.

     <li>Make the resulting collated configuration version controlled. Publish
approved promises for all hosts to download from a trusted source.

        </ol>

   <p>A review procedure for policy-promises is a good solution if you want
to delegate responsibility for different parts of a policy to
different sources. Human judgement as the `arbiter' is irreplaceable,
but tools can be added to make conflicts easier to detect.

   <p>Promise theory underlines that, if a host or computing device accepts
policy from any source, then it is alone and entirely responsible for
this decision. The ultimate responsibility for the published version
policy is the vetting agent. This creates a shallow hierarchy, but
there is no reason why this formal body could not be comprised of
representatives from the multiple teams.

   <p>The figure below shows how a number of policy authoring teams can work together
safely and securely to write the policy for a number of hosts, by vetting through
a checkpoint, in a classic `bow-tie' formation.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Granting the right to switch on special pre-defined policies</h3>

<p>CFEngine offers one technological convenience that is relevant to RBAC. 
In the Clark-Wilson security model, non-privileged users can be
granted limited privilege to execute predefined commands that are
locked down to specific actions. The Unix <code>ps</code> and <code>passwd</code>
commands are examples of this, for example.

   <p>Most users do not need to touch CFEngine at all, because policy is
checked very regularly and promises are enforced with 5 minute
intervals. In other words, for most users, just waiting will fix anny
problem. In some cases, there are extraordinary promises or tasks that
one does not want implemented without human oversight. In that
instance, one places the relevant promises in a context that is not normally
active. Users can then activate those sleeping promises by defining the
context class manually.
<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent mybundle
{
<span class="red">files:
</span>
  extraordindary::

<span class="comment">    # ... promises ...
</span>
}
</pre>
Privileged users who have access to the system do not need RBAC to do this
as they already have all credentials they need, and can achieve the same thing
by running the agent with a defined class, e.g.

<pre class="verbatim">
host# cf-agent -D extraordinary

</pre>
However, it is also possible to grant access to these parts of a CFEngine policy that are normally
switched off by using <code>cf-serverd</code> to mediate privilege to execute the agent with this class
active. For example, setting:

<pre class="verbatim">bundle server access_rules()
{
<span class="red">roles:
</span>
<span class="comment">  # Allow mark
</span>

  "extraordinary"<span class="red">  authorize </span>=> { "mark", "sally" };
}

</pre>
and running:
<pre class="verbatim">
host# cf-runagent -H special_host -D extraordinary

</pre>
would achieve the same effect without granting any rights to change
the policy.

   <p>In this example CFEngine promises to grant permission to users
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mark</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sally</span></samp>&rsquo; to remotely activate classes matching the regular
expression &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">extraordinary</span></samp>&rsquo; when using the <code>cf-runagent</code> to
activate CFEngine. In this way one can implement a form of Role Based
Access Control (RBAC) for unprivileged users, provided users do not
have privileged access on the host directly. User identity is based on
trusted CFEngine keys created by the user and exchanged with the server.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Many provisioning and management systems are indeed
effectively remote execution agents and thus RBAC is more relevant to them.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> A single point of
definition could also be a single point of failure.  In CFEngine, a
central policy hub is not a point of failure, because each agent
caches all the resources it needs to maintain systems according to its
current model. At worst, the loss of a hub would mean a delay to
updates.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> User who are adept at automated
configuration might disagree, as automation makes it easy to harden
all hosts equally well. Network policies such as firewalls, etc, are
however, simpler to manage for a single host.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> Note that the decision to collect policy updates from somewhere is
itself a policy decision in CFEngine, so users should always think carefully
about these decisions.</p>
