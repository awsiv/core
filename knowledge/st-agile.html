<h2 class="chapter">1 Defining Agility</h2>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We intuitively recognize agility as the capability to respond rapidly
enough and flexibly enough to a difficult challenge. If we imagine an
animal surviving in the wild, a climber on a rock-face or a wrestler engaged in
combat, we identify the skills of <i>anticipation</i>, <i>speed</i> of response and
the ability to <i>adapt</i> or bend without breaking to meet the challenges.

     <ul>
<li>Anticipate. 
<li>Act. 
<li>Adapt. 
</ul>

   <p>In infrastructure management, agility represents the need to handle
changing demand for service, to repair an absence of service, and to
improve and deploy new services in response to changes from users and
market requirements. It is tied to economic, business or work-related
imperatives by the need to maintain a competitive lead.

   <p>The compelling event that our system must respond to might represent
danger, or merely a self-imposed deadline.  In either case, there is
generally a penalty associated with a lack of agility: a blow, a fall or
a loss.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What comprises agility?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

To understand agility, we have to understand time and the capacity for change. Agility is a
relative concept: it's about adapting fast enough, in the right context. 
Let's try to gain an engineering perspective on agility to see what
enables it and what throttles it.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In a challenge there are four stages that need attention:

     <ul>
<li>To comprehend the challenge. 
<li>To solve the challenge. 
<li>To respond to the challenge. 
<li>To confirm or verify the response. 
</ul>
   </td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Each of these phases takes time and requires a certain flexibility. 
Our goal is to keep these phases simple and therefore cheap for the long-term. 
Affording the time and flexibility needed is the key to being agile. 
Technology can help with this, if we adopt sound practices.

   <p>We can go
one step further and define an engineering scale of agility as the
ratio of available speed to required speed and ratio of number ways a
system can be changed to the number of ways imperatives require us to
change.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">  Agility ~ Available speed under control        Changes available
           -----------------------------  *  -----------------------
                  Required speed                 Changes Required
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">Although such a scale might be hard to track in practice,
the definition makes simple engineering sense<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and brings
some insight into what we need to think about.

   <p>What is required speed?  It is is the rate of change we have to be
able to enact in order to achieve and maintain a state (keep a
promise) that is aligned with our intent.  This requires a dependence
on technology and human processes. 
The weakest link in any chain of dependencies limits the speed. 
The weakest link might be a human who doesn't understand what to do, or a
broken wire or a misconfigured switch, so there are many
possible failure modes for agility. An organization is an information
rich <i>society</i> with complex interplays between Man and Machine; agility
challenges us to think about these weakest links and try to bolster
them with CFEngine's technology.

   <p>For example:

     <ul>
<li>If we think in terms of
services, it is the Service Level you have to achieve in order to
comply with a Service Level Agreement.

     <li>If we think of a support
ticket, it is the speed we have to work at in order to keep the impact
of an unpredicted change within acceptable levels. 
</ul>

   <p>What we call acceptable
is clearly a subjective judgement, i.e. a matter for policy to decide. So
there are many uncertainties and relativisms in such definitions. It would
be inconceivable to claim any kind of industry standard for these.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="agility.png" alt="agility.png"></div>
<div align="center">How agility depends on technology measures.</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>The available maximum speed of any system is usually called its `capacity'. 
We can write some scaling laws for the dependencies of agility to see where
the failure modes might arise.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">      Average available speed ~ Expected capacity * reliability
                                ----------------------------
                                           Consumers
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
This expression says that the rate at which we get work done on average depends
no only on how we share maximum capacity amongst a number of different consumers,
clients, processes, etc, but also on how much of the time this capacity is fully
available, perhaps because systems are down or unavailable.

   <p>The appearance of reliability in this expression therefore tells us that maintenance
of the system, and anticipation of failure will play a key role in agility. 
Remarkably this is usually unexpected for most practitioners, and most of system planning
goes into first time deployment, rather than maintaining operational state.

   <p>The next challenge is concerns a human limitation. One of the greatest challenges in any
organization lies in comprehending the system.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">       Comprehensibility ~  Predictability (Reliability)
                           ----------------------------
                                 Machines * rules
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Our ability to comprehend behaviour depends on how predictable it is, i.e. 
how well it meets our expectations. For technology, we expect behaviour
to be as close as possible on our intentions. CFEngine's maintenance of promises
ensures that this is done with best possible effort and a rapid cycle of checking.

   <p>To keep the number of rules to a minimum, CFEngine avoids mixing up
<i>what</i> policy is being expressed with <i>how</i> the promises are
kept. It uses a declarative language to separate the what from the
how. This allows ordinary users to see what was intended without
having to know the meaning of how, as was the case when scripting was
used to configure systems.

   <p>Finally, if we think about the efficiency of a configuration, which is
another way of estimating its simplicity, we are interested in how
much work it takes to represent our intentions.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">             Efficiency ~  Number of objects affected
                           ----------------------------
                                Number of rules
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Patterns play a role too in simplifying. This affects not just the
technology cost, but also the cognitive cost (comprehensibility). 
Efficiency lies in the
power of the model to encapsulate needs with few rules. In the
underlying technology, this represents an ability to encapsulate and
represent patterns without losing flexibility. Making black boxes is
easy, but using flexible or programmable boxes is simple.

   <p>From the perspective of agility, regular scheduling of a verifiable and comprehensible
configuration model, combined with speed of verification and repair
are the values we covet for agility.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Aspects of CFEngine that bring agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We can now summarize some qualities of CFEngine that favour agility:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Ability to express clear intentions about desired outcome (comprehension). 
<li>Availability of insight into system performance and state (comprehension). 
<li>Ability to customize policy down to a low level without programming (adaptability).

     <li>The default, parallelized execution framework verifies promises every 5 minutes
for rapid fault detection and change deployment. 
<li>System monitoring/sampling rate is every 2.5 minutes (Nyquist frequency),
for automated hands-free response to errors. 
<li>The lightweight resource footprint of CFEngine does not consume system resources
required for actual business (low overhead, maximum capacity).

     <li>Ability to increase number of clients without significant penalty (scalability and ease of increasing capacity).

   </ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
As indicated above, time-scales are the key to enabling agility. Different environments
have rather different needs:

     <ul>
<li>Web shops:
Resource consumption is an issue on
busy web servers, however web services are typically quite slow already and it is
easy to load balance a web service, so resource efficiency is not
usually considered a priority until the possible savings become
significant with thousands of hosts.

     <p>Credit card information is subject PCI-DSS regulation and requires more
intensive verification, but these systems are often separated from the main
web service.

     <p>Run-frequency of CFEngine is not critical here, but speed of execution
is a factor during updates.  During software updates speed and
orchestration are issues, as time lost during upgrades is often
revenue lost.

     <p>The level of customization in a web shop could be quite high, as there
is a stack of interdependent services including databases and name
services that have to work seamlessly, and the rate of deployment of
new versions of the software might be relatively high.

     <li>Cloud providers
For Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers and consumers, set up
and tear-down rates are quite high so efficient and speedy configuration
is imperative. For Software and Platform as a service providers, stability,
high performance and regulation are key issues, and scaling up and down
for demand is probably the fastest rate of change.

     <li>High Performance Computing:

     <p>High performance clusters are typically found in Oil and Gas,
Financial, weather and aviation industries, and other places where raw
computation is used to number crunch. The lightweight footprint of
CFEngine is a major benefit here, as every CPU cycle and megabyte of
memory is precious.

     <p>In clusters the rate of customization is low, so the need for agility
is generally low, and raw speed is the issue.

     <li>Government and finance sectors:

     <p>Security and version control of approved software are major challenges
in government regulated institutions. Agility has been a low priority
in the past, but this will have to change as the rest of the world's
IT services accelerate.

     <p>High availability in CFEngine is used for continuous auditing and
security. Passing regulatory frameworks like SOX, SAS-70, ISO 20k, etc
can depend on this non-intrusive availability. Liability is a major
concern and significant levels of approval are generally required to
make changes, with tracking of individual responsibility. Out-of-hours
change windows are common for making upgrades and making intended
changes. Scalability of reporting is a key here, but change happens
slowly.

   </ul>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How does complexity affect agility?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

In the past<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>, it was common to manage change by making
everything the same. Today, the individual custom experience is what today's information
society craves.  Being forced into a single mold is a hindrance to
adaptability and therefore to agility. In the world of commerce,
consumers rule the roost, and agility is competitive edge in a market of
many more players than before.

   <p>Today, we live in a culture of `ease', and we focus on what can be
done easily rather than worrying about long term simplicity (Total Cost
of Ownership). At CFEngine, we believe that `easy' answers often suffer from
oversimplification issues. Anyone can make something appear superficially
easy by working hard on behalf of a user, or by papering  over a mess. 
Moreover, making a risky process `too easy' can encourage haste and
carelessness.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Infrastructure engineering is a potentially high risk occupation, as many
users rely on the infrastructure for their livelihoods. Simplicity is
a key strategy to minimizing Total Cost of Ownership. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Making something truly simple is a very hard problem, but it is an
investment in future change. What is easy today might be expensive to make easy tomorrow. 
But if something is truly simple, then the work is all up front in learning
the basics, and does not come
as an unexpected surprise down the line.

   <p>At CFEngine, we believe in agility through simplicity, and so we
invest continuous research into making our technology genuinely simple for trained
users. We know that a novice user will not necessarily find CFEngine easy, but
after a small amount of training, CFEngine will be a tool for life, not just a hurried
deployment.

   <p>Simplicity in CFEngine is addressed in the following ways:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>The software has few dependencies that complicate installation and upgrade. 
<li>Changes made are atomic and minimize dependencies. 
<li>Each host works as an independent entity, reducing communication fragility. 
<li>The configuration model is based on Promise Theory &ndash; a very consistent and simple
approach to modelling autonomous cooperative systems. 
<li>All hosts run a basically identical agent on all operating
platforms (from mobile phones to mainframes), and understand a common language of intent which they
can translate into any operating system's naive system calls. 
<li>Comprehensive facilities are allowed for making use of patterns and other total-information-reducing
tactics. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
A certain level of complexity is necessary and desirable. 
Some organizations still try to remain agile by avoiding complexity. However, the ability
to respond to complex scenarios often requires us to delve into complexity. Avoiding
it merely creates a lack of agility as we are constrained by the requirement of
oversimplification.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Packaging limits agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>Atomicity, or avoidance of dependency, is a key approach to simplicity. 
Today this is often used to argue to packaging of software.

   <p>Handling software and system configuration as packages of data makes
certain processes appear superficially easy, because you get a single object
to deal with, that has a name and a version number. 
However, to maintain flexibility we should
not bundle too many features into a package.

   <p>For example, a tin of
soup or a microwave meal might be a superficially easy way to make
dinner, for many scenarios, but the day you get a visitor with special
dietary requirements (vegetarian or allergic etc) then the
prepackaging is a major obstacle to adapting: the recipe cannot be
changed and repackaged without going back to the factory that made
it. Thus oversimplification generally tends to end up sending up back
to work around the technology.

   <p>CFEngine's modelling language gives you control over the smallest
ingredients, but also allows you to package your own containers
or work with other suppliers' packages. This ensures that
adaptability is not sacrificed for superficial ease.

<pre class="sp">

All configuration issues, including fitness for purpose, boil down to
three things: why, what and how. Knowing why we do something is the
most important way of avoiding error and risk of failure. Simplicity
then comes from keeping the `what' and the `how' separate, and
reducing the how to a predictable, repairable transaction. This is
what CFEngine's <i>convergent promise</i> technology does.

   <p>Knowledge is an antidote to uncertainty. Insight into patterns, brings
simplicity to the information management, and insight into behaviour
allows us to estimate impact of change, thus avoiding the risk associated
with agility.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In configuration `what' represents transitory knowledge, while `how'
is often more lasting and can be absorbed into the infrastructure. The

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Increasing capacity</h3>

<p>Capacity in IT infrastructure is increased by increasing machine
power. Today, at the limit of hardware capacity, this typically means
increasing the number of machines serving a task. Cloud services have
increased the speed agility with which resources can be deployed &ndash;
whether public or private cloud &ndash;
but they do not usually provide any customization tools.  This is
where CFEngine brings significant value.

   <p>The rapid deployment of new services is assisted by:

     <ul>
<li>Virtualization hypervisor control or private cloud management (libvirt integration). 
<li>Rapid, massively-parallelized custom configuration. 
<li>Avoidance of network dependencies. 
</ul>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Maximizing business imperatives</h3>

<p>Agility allows companies and public services to compete and address
the needs of continuous service improvement. This requires insight
into IT operations from business and vice versa. Recently, the
`DevOps' movement in web arenas has emphasized the need for a more
streamlined approach to integrating business-driven change and IT
operations. Whatever we choose to call this, and in whatever arena,
`connecting the dots between business and IT' is a major enabler for
agility to business imperatives.

   <p>Some business issues are inherently complex, e.g. software
customization and security, because they introduce multifaceted
conflicts of interest that need to resolved with clear documentation
about <i>why</i>.

   <p>The ability to model our intentions about these matters in a clearly
understandable way enables insight and understanding; this, in turn,
allows us to anticipate and comprehend challenges. CFEngine's
knowledge management features help to make the configuration itself a
documentation of the system. Instead of relying on command line tools
to interact, the user documents intentions (as `promises to be kept'). 
These promises, and how well they have been kept, can be examined either
from the original specification or in the Mission Portal.

   <p>In the industrial age, the strategy was to supply sufficient force to
a small problem in order to `control' it by brute force. In systems
today the scale and complexity are such that no such brute force
approach can seriously be expected to work. Thus one is reduced to a more even
state of affairs: learning to work with the environment `as is',
with clear expectations of what is possible and controlling only certain
parts on which crucial things depend.

Related to capacity is the issue of scaling services for massive available
capacity.

   <p>By scalability we mean the intrinsic capacity of a system to
handle growth. Growth in a system can occur in three ways: by the volume of input
the system must handle, in the total size of its infrastructure,
and by the complexity of the processes within it.

   <p>For a system to be called scalable, growth should proceed unhindered,
i.e. the size and volume of processing may expand without
significantly affecting the average service level per node.

   <p>Although most of us have an intuitive notion of what scalability
means, a full understanding of it is a very complex issue, mainly
because there are so many factors to take into account. One factor
that is often forgotten in considering scalability, is the human
ability to <i>comprehend</i> the system as it grows. Limitations of
comprehension often lead to over-simplification and
lowest-common-denominator standardization.

   <p>Scalability is addressed in a separate document: <i>Scale and Scalability</i>,
so we shall not discuss it further here.

Agility is going to be an increasingly important and prevalent feature
of the modern world, as we enter the information-based
society. Competitiveness edge in both private sector and research
makes agility the actual product of a not-too-distant tomorrow.

   <p>Who or what makes agility a reality? The simple answer to this
question is everyone and everything. Change is a chain of dependent
activities and the weakest link in the chain is the limiting
factor. Often, that is human knowledge, since it is the part of the
chain that we take most for granted.

   <p>CFEngine has been carefully designed to support agile operations for
the long term, by investing in knowledge management, speed and efficiency. 
We recommend all infrastructure engineers to reexamine the role of time in
their systems.

   <p>Tempus fugit!

speed matches need, and we have the capability to make all required
