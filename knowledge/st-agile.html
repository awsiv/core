<h2 class="chapter">1 Understanding Agility</h2>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We intuitively recognize agility as the capability to respond rapidly
enough and flexibly enough to a difficult challenge. If we imagine an
animal surviving in the wild, a climber on a rock-face or a wrestler engaged in
combat, we identify the skills of <i>anticipation</i>, <i>speed</i> of response and
the ability to <i>adapt</i> or bend without breaking to meet the challenges.

     <ul>
<li>Anticipate. 
<li>Act. 
<li>Adapt. 
</ul>

   <p>In infrastructure management, agility represents the need to handle
changing demand for service, to repair an absence of service, and to
improve and deploy new services in response to changes from users and
market requirements. It is tied to economic, business or work-related
imperatives by the need to maintain a competitive lead.

   <p>The compelling event that our system must respond to might represent
danger, or merely a self-imposed deadline.  In either case, there is
generally a penalty associated with a lack of agility: a blow, a fall or
a loss.

<h3 class="section">1.1 What make agility possible?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

To understand agility, we have to understand time and the <i>capacity</i>
for change. Agility is a relative concept: it's about adapting quickly
enough, in the right context, with the right measure and in the right
way.  Below, we'll try to gain an <i>engineering</i> perspective on agility to
see what enables it and what throttles it.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
To respond to a challenge there are four stages that need attention:

     <ul>
<li>To comprehend the challenge. 
<li>To solve the challenge. 
<li>To respond to the challenge. 
<li>To confirm or verify the response. 
</ul>
   </td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Each of these phases takes actual clock-time and requires a certain flexibility. 
Our goal is to keep these phases simple and therefore cheap for the long-term. 
Affording the time and flexibility needed is the key to being agile. 
Technology can help with this, if we adopt sound practices.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Intuitively, we understand agility to be related to our capacity to
respond to a situation. 
Let's try to pin this idea down more precisely. 
</td></tr></table>

<h3 class="section">1.2 The capacity of a system</h3>

<p>The capacity of a system is defined to be its maximum rate of
change. Most often, this refers to speed of the system response to a
single request<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>In engineering, capacity is measured in <i>changes per second</i>, so it
represents the maximum speed of a system within a single thread of
activity<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Understanding-Agility">Understanding Agility</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.3 Speed</h3>

<p>Speed is the rate at which change takes place. For a configuration tool like CFEngine,
speed can be measured either as

     <dl>
<dt><i>Clock speed</i><dd>The actual elapsed wall-clock time-rate at which work gets done,
including any breaks and pauses in the schedule.

     <p>This depends on how often checks are made, or the interval between them,
 e.g. in CFEngine, the default
schedule is to verify promises every five minutes.

     <br><dt><i>System speed</i><dd>The average speed of the system when it is actually busy working on a problem,
excluding breaks and pauses. For example, once CFEngine has been scheduled
at the end of a five minute interval, it might take a few seconds to
make necessary changes. 
</dl>

   <p>Engineers can try to define an engineering scale of agility
as the ratio of available speed to required speed and ratio of number
ways a system can be changed to the number of ways imperatives require
us to change.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p><i>Agility is proportional to both how much speed we can muster compared to what is required,
and the number of change-capabilities we possess, compared to what
we need to meet a challenge. In other words: how well equipped are we? 
As engineers, we could write something like this:</i>

<pre class="verbatim">
                Available speed under control        Changes available
    Agility =~  -----------------------------  *  -----------------------
                      Required speed                 Changes Required
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Although such a scale might be hard to measure and follow in practice,
the definition makes simple engineering sense<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and brings
some insight into what we need to think about. 
What it suggests is that agility is a combination of <i>speed</i> and <i>precision</i>.

   <p>What is required speed?  It is is the rate of change we have to be
able to enact in order to achieve and maintain a state (keep a
promise) that is aligned with our intent.  This requires a dependence
on technology and human processes.

   <p>The weakest link in any chain of dependencies limits the speed. 
The weakest link might be a human who doesn't understand what to do, or a
broken wire or a misconfigured switch, so there are many
possible failure modes for agility. An organization is an information
rich <i>society</i> with complex interplays between Man and Machine; agility
challenges us to think about these weakest links and try to bolster
them with CFEngine's technology.

   <p>For example:

     <ul>
<li>If we think in terms of
services, it is the Service Level you have to achieve in order to
comply with a Service Level Agreement.

     <li>If we think of a support
ticket, it is the speed we have to work at in order to keep the impact
of an unpredicted change within acceptable levels. 
</ul>

   <p>What we call `acceptable'
is a subjective judgement, i.e. a matter for policy to decide. So
there are many uncertainties and relativisms in such definitions. It would
be inconceivable to claim any kind of industry standard for these.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="agility.png" alt="agility.png"></div>
<div align="center">How agility depends on technology measures.</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>We can write some scaling laws for the dependencies of agility to see where
the failure modes might arise.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>The speed available to meet a challenge
is (on average) the maximum speed we can reliably maintain over time
divided by the number of challenges we have to share between.</i>
<pre class="verbatim">
                                Expected capacity * reliability
    Average available speed =~  -------------------------------
                                    Consumers or challenges
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
This expression says that the rate at which we get work done on average depends
no only on how we share maximum capacity amongst a number of different consumers,
clients, processes, etc, but also on how much of the time this capacity is fully
available, perhaps because systems are down or unavailable.

   <p>The appearance of reliability in this expression therefore tells us that maintenance
of the system, and anticipation of failure will play a key role in agility. 
Remarkably this is usually unexpected for most practitioners, and most of system planning
goes into first time deployment, rather than maintaining operational state.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Precision</h3>

<p>Acting quickly is not enough: we also need to be accurate in responding to
change<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We need to be able to:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Model the desired outcome accurately in terms of universal policy coordinates: Why, When, Where, What, How. 
<li>Maximize the chance that the promised outcome will be achieved. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Precision is maximized when:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Changes are `precise', i.e. they can be made at a highly granular level, without disturbing areas that are not relevant (few side-effects). 
<li>Policy is able to model or describe the desired state accurately, i.e. within the relevant area, the state is within acceptable tolerances. 
<li>If any assumptions are hidden, they are describable in terms of the model, not determined by the limitations of the software<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.

     <li>The agent executes the details of the model quickly and verifiably,
in a partially unpredictable environment, i.e. it should be fault tolerant. 
<li>If the model cannot be implemented, it is possible to determine why
and decide whether the problem lies in an incorrect assumption or a flaw in the implementation. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine is a fault tolerant system &ndash; it continues to work on what it

<h3 class="section">1.5 Comprehension</h3>

<p>The next challenge is concerns a human limitation. One of the greatest
challenges in any organization lies in comprehending the system.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>Comprehensibility increases if something is predictable, or steady in its
behaviour, but it decreases in proportion to the number of things we need
to think about &ndash; which includes the many different contexts such as environments,
or groups of machines with different purposes or profiles.</i>
<pre class="verbatim">                        Predictability (Reliability)    Predictability

</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Our ability to comprehend behaviour depends on how predictable it is, i.e. 
how well it meets our expectations. For technology, we expect
behaviour to be as close as possible on our intentions. CFEngine's
maintenance of promises ensures that this is done with best possible
effort and a rapid cycle of checking.

   <p>To keep the number of contexts to a minimum, CFEngine avoids mixing up
<i>what</i> policy is being expressed with <i>how</i> the promises are
kept. It uses a declarative language to separate the what from the
how. This allows ordinary users to see what was intended without
having to know the meaning of how, as was the case when scripting was
used to configure systems.

<h3 class="section">1.6 Efficiency</h3>

<p>Finally, if we think about the efficiency of a configuration, which is
another way of estimating its simplicity, we are interested in how
much work it takes to represent our intentions.  There are two ways we
can think about efficiency: the efficiency of the automated process
and the human efficiency in deploying it.

   <p>If the technology has a high overhead, the cost of maintaining
change is high and efficiency is low:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>The efficiency of the technology decreases with the more resources
it uses, e.g. like memory and CPU. Resources used to run the technology
itself are pure overhead and take away from the real work of your system.</i>
<pre class="verbatim">                                      Resources used
         Resource Efficiency =~  1 -  ---------------
                                      Total resources
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
It is a design goal of CFEngine to maintain minimal overhead in
all situations. The second aspect of efficiency is how much planning
or rule-making is needed to manage the relevant issues.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>The efficiency of a model decreases when you put more effort into
managing a certain number of things. If you can manage a large number
of things with a few simple constraints, that is efficient.</i>
<pre class="verbatim">                              Number of objects affected
      Model Efficiency =~  -------------------------------
                           Number of rules and constraints
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
General patterns play a role too in simplifying, because the reduce the
number of special rules and constraints down to fewer more generic rules. 
If we make good use of patterns, we can make few rules that cover many
cases. If there are no discernible patterns, every special case is a
costly exception.  This affects not just the technology cost, but also
the cognitive cost (i.e. the comprehensibility).

   <p>Efficiency therefore plays a role in agility, because it affects the
cost of change. Greater efficiency generally means greater speed,
and more greater likelihood for precision.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Aspects of CFEngine that bring agility</h2>

We can now summarize some qualities of CFEngine that favour agility:
   <pre class="sp">

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Ability to express clear intentions about desired outcome (comprehension).

<li>Ability to bundle related details into simple containers (comprehension without loss of adaptability).

     <li>Ability to accurately customize policy down to a low level without programming (adaptability).

     <li>Ability to recover quickly from faults and failures. The default, parallelized execution framework verifies promises every 5 minutes
for rapid fault detection and change deployment (clock speed)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a>
. 
<li>A quick system monitoring/sampling rate &ndash; every 2.5 minutes (Nyquist frequency),
for automated hands-free response to errors. 
<li>Ability to recover cheaply. The lightweight resource footprint of CFEngine that consumes few system resources
required for actual business (system speed &ndash; low overhead, maximum capacity).

     <li>Ability to increase number of clients without significant penalty (scalability and easy increase of capacity).

<h3 class="section">2.1 What agility means in different environments</h3>

<p>Let's examine some example cases where agility plays a role. 
Agility only has meaning relative to an environment, so in the following
sections, we cite the remarks of CFEngine users (in quotes),  and
their example environments.

   <p>Users' expectations for agility can differ dramatically in the present; but if we
think just a few years down the line, and follow the trends, it seems clear
that limber systems must prevail in IT's evolutionary jungle.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Desktop management</h4>

<p>"The desktop space can be a very volatile environment, with multiple platforms."

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
Speed is
essential when there is a need to respond to a security threat that
affects all of the desktop systems; e.g. when dealing with malware
that requires the distribution of updated <samp><span class="file">virus.dat</span></samp> files,
etc. CFEngine can be very helpful by automating the process of
distributing and restarting the application responsible for virus
detection and mitigation. Systems that have been breached, need to be
returned to known and secure state quickly to avoid loss. CFEngine can
quickly detect and correct host based intrusions using file-scanning
techniques and can secure hosts for examination, or just repair them
quickly.

     <p>Another case for agility lies in user request processing. For example,
when a new user joins a workplace and needs resources such as desktop,
laptop, phone, Internet connection, VPN connection, VM instances,
etc. Speed is of the essence to minimize employee downtime.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>
Desktop environments can involve many different platforms: Windows,
multiple flavours of Linux and Macintosh, etc. A uniform low-cost way
of `provisioning' and maintaining all of these, as well as responding
to common threats is of significant value.

     <p>Precision is important to ensure that the resources made available are
indeed the correct ones. Inaccuracy can be a potential security issue,
or merely a productivity question.

     <p>Precision also comes into play when an enterprise rolls out new
patches or productivity upgrades. These upgrades need to be uniformly
and precisely distributed to all of the desktop systems during a given
change window. By design, desktop clients running CFEngine
automatically check for changes in system state and can precisely
propagate desired state. In the case of system restoration due to
corruption or hardware failure, CFEngine can greatly reduce the time
needed to return to the most current enterprise build.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Web shops</h4>

<p>Modern web-based companies often base their entire financial
operations around an active web site. Down-time of the web service is
mission critical.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
The frequency of maintenance is not usually critical in web shops,
since configuration changes can be planned to occur over hours rather
than minutes.  During software updates and system repairs, however,
speed and orchestration are issues, as time lost during upgrades is
often revenue lost, and a lack of coordination of multiple parts could
cause effective downtime.

     <p>It is therefore easy to scale the management of a web service, as change
is rarely considered to be time-critical.

     <p>Resource availability for the web service is an issue on busy web
servers, however web services are typically quite slow already and it
is easy to load balance a web service, so resource efficiency of the
management software is not usually considered a high priority, until
the possible savings become significant with thousands of hosts.

     <p>Credit card information is subject to PCI-DSS regulation and requires
a continuous verification for auditing purposes, but these systems are
often separated from the main web service. Speed of execution can be seen
as an advantage by some auditors where repairs to security matters and
detection of breaches are carefully monitored.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>
The level of customization in a web shop could be quite high, as there
is a stack of interdependent services including databases and name
services that have to work seamlessly, and the rate of deployment of
new versions of the software might be relatively high.

     <p>Customization and individuality is a large part of a website's business
competitiveness. Maintaining precise

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.4 High Performance Computing</h4>

<p>High Performance clusters are typically found in the oil and gas
industry, in movie, financial, weather and aviation industries, and
any other modelling applications where raw computation is used to
crunch numbers.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
The lightweight footprint of CFEngine is a major benefit here, as
every CPU cycle and megabyte of memory is precious, so workflow is not
disrupted.

     <p>"A single node in the compute grid being out of sync with the others
can cause the entire grid to cause failed jobs or otherwise introduce
unpredictability into the environment, as it may produce results that
differ from its peers.  Thus it is imperative that repairs to an
incorrect state happen as soon as possible, to minimize the impact of
these issues."

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>"Precision is exquisitely important in an HPC grid.  When making a
configuration change, due to the homogeneity of the environment, small
changes can have enormous impacts due to the quantity of affected
systems.  I liken this to the "monoculture" problem in replanted
forests &ndash; everything is the same, so what would ordinarily be a
small, easily-contained problem like a fungus outbreak, quickly
spreads into an uncontrollable disaster.  Thus, with HPC systems it is
imperative that any changes deployed are precise, to ensure that no
unintended consequences will occur.  This is clearly directly related
to comprehensibility of the environment &ndash; it is difficult or
impossible to make a precise change when you don't fully comprehend
the environment."

"Government systems are reviewed and audited under FISMA and so one has
often thought in terms of the ability to reduce complexity to make the
problem manageable. Government typically wants the one-size-fits-all
solution to system management and could benefit from something that
can manage complexity and diversity while providing some central
control (I bet you hate that word).  The only thing we might have in
common with finance is auditing but I'm sure the methods and goals are

One of the key factors in finance is liability. Fear of error, has led
to very slow processing of change.

     <p>High availability in CFEngine is used for continuous auditing and
security. Passing regulatory frameworks like SOX, SAS-70, ISO 20k, etc
can depend on this non-intrusive availability. Liability is a major
concern and significant levels of approval are generally required to
make changes, with tracking of individual responsibility. Out-of-hours
change windows are common for making upgrades and making intended
changes. Scalability of reporting is a key here, but change happens
slowly.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>
Security and hence tight control of approved software are major challenges
in government regulated institutions. Agility has been a low priority
in the past, but this will have to change as the rest of the world's

described below.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
Manufacturing is a curious mix of all the mention areas and more. In
addition to the above, there is an tool component. The
tools can design, build, test, track, and ship a physical
unit. Downtime of any component is measured in missed revenue,
so speed of detection and repair is crucial.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>

     <p>"We need to ensure agility and accuracy of
reporting. We need to know what is going on at any microsecond of the
day. One faulty tool can throw a wrench in the whole works. The
digital equivalent of the steam whistle to stop the line.

     <p>From there, all the tool information is fed upstream to servers, from
there to databases, then reports, that statistical analysis, and so
on. Each piece needs to move with the product and incorporate it. It
is a steady chain of events where are all information is liquid and
relevant.

     <p>Not only do you have the security requirements, from virus updates to
top secret classification, but these tools need to never stop,
ever. Also, these tools need constant reconfiguration depending on the
product they are working on: e.g. you can't use the same set of
procedures on XBox chip as a cellphone memory module. And all the
tools are different too: one may be a probe to detect microscopic
fractures in the layers, one tool may just track it's position in
line. Supply and demand, cost and revenue."

<h3 class="section">2.2 Separating What from How (DevOps)</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

If you have to designs a programmatic solution to a challenge, it will
cost you highly in terms of cognitive investment, testing and clarity
of purpose to future users. Thinking <i>process</i> (how) instead of <i>knowledge</i> (what) is
a classic carry-over from the era of 2nd Wave industrialization<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Think of CFEngine as an active knowledge management system,
rather than as a relatively passive programming framework.

   <p>For `DevOps': programming is for your application, consider its deployment
to be part of the documentation. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Many programmatic systems and `APIs' force you to explain how
something will be accomplished and the statement about `what' the
outcome will be is left to an implicit assumption. Such systems are
called imperative systems.

   <p>CFEngine is a declarative system. In a declarative system, the reverse
is true. You begin by writing down What you are trying to accomplish
and the How is more implicit. The way this is done is by separating
data from algorithm in the model. CFEngine encourages this with its
language, but you can go even further by using the tools optimally.

   <p>CFEngine allows you to represent raw data as variables, or as
strings within your policy. For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     bundle agent name
     {
     vars:
     
       "main_server" string =&gt; "abc.123.com";
     
       "package_source[ubuntu]" string =&gt; "repository.ubuntu.com";
       "package_source[suse]"   string =&gt; "repository.suse.com";
     
      # Promises that use these data
      #
      # packages:
      # processes:
      # files:
      # services: , etc
     
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">By separating `what' data like this out of the details of how
they are used, it becomes easier to comprehend and locate, and it
becomes fast to change, and the accuracy of the change is easily
perceived. Moreover, CFEngine can track the impact of such a change by
seeing where the data are used.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine's knowledge management can tell you which system promises
depend on which data in a clear manner, so you will know the impact
of a change to the data. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>You can also keep data outside your policy in databases, or sources like:

     <ul>
<li>LDAP
<li>NIS
<li>DNS
<li>System files
</ul>

<p class="noindent">For example, reading in data from a system file is very convenient. 
This is what Unix-like system do for passwords and user management.

<pre class="smallexample"></pre>
   <p>What you might lose when making an input matrix is the <i>why</i>. 
Is there an explanation that fits all these cases, or does each
case need a special explanation? We recommend that you include
as much information as possible about `why'.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Packaging limits agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>Atomicity enables agility. Atomicity, or the avoidance of dependency, is a
key approach to simplicity. Today this is often used to argue to
packaging of software.

   <p>Handling software and system configuration as packages of data makes
certain processes appear superficially easy, because you get a single object
to deal with, that has a name and a version number. 
However, to maintain flexibility we should
not bundle too many features into a package.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>A tin of
soup or a microwave meal might be a superficially easy way to make
dinner, for many scenarios, but the day you get a visitor with special
dietary requirements (vegetarian or allergic etc) then the
prepackaging is a major obstacle to adapting: the recipe cannot be
changed and repackaged without going back to the factory that made
it. Thus oversimplification generally tends to end up sending up back
to work around the technology.</i>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine's modelling language gives you control over the smallest
ingredients, but also allows you to package your own containers
or work with other suppliers' packages. This ensures that
adaptability is not sacrificed for superficial ease.

   <p>For example: your system's package model can cooperate with
CFEngine make asking CFEngine to promise to work with the
package manager:

<pre class="verbatim">
packages:

  "apache2";
  "php5";
  "opera";

</pre>

<p class="noindent">If you need to change what happens under the covers, it
is very simple to do this in CFEngine. You can copy the details
of the existing methods, because the details are not hard-coded,
and you can make your own custom version quickly.

packages:

  "apache2"  

    package_method => my_special_package_manager_interface;

<h3 class="section">2.4 How abstraction improves agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Abstraction allows us to turn special cases into general patterns. This leads to a compression
of information, as we can make defaults for the general patterns, which do not have to be
repeated each time.

   <p>Service promises are good example of this<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a>, for example:

<pre class="verbatim">services:

  "www";
 
</pre>
In this promise, all of the details of what happens to turn on the
web service have been hidden behind this simple identifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This looks easy, but is it simple?

   <p>In this case, it is both easy and simple. Let's check why.  We have to
ask the question: how does this abstraction improve speed and precision
in the long run?

   <p>Obviously, it provides short term ease by allowing many complex
operations to take place with the utterance of just a single
word<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a>. But any
software can pull that smoke and mirrors trick. To be agile, it must
be possible to understand and change the details of what happens when
this services is promised. Some tools hard-code processes for this kind
of statement, requiring an understanding of programming in a
development language to alter the result. In CFEngine, the definitions
underlying this are written in the high-level declarative CFEngine
language, using the same paradigm, and can therefore be altered by the
users who need the promise, with only a small amount of work.

   <p>Thus, simplicity is assured by having consistency of interface
and low cost barrier to changing the meaning of the definition.

<h3 class="section">2.5 Increasing system capacity (by scaling)</h3>

<p>Capacity in IT infrastructure is increased by increasing machine
power. Today, at the limit of hardware capacity, this typically means
increasing the number of machines serving a task. Cloud services have
increased the speed agility with which resources can be deployed &ndash;
whether public or private cloud &ndash;
but they do not usually provide any customization tools.  This is
where CFEngine brings significant value.

   <p>The rapid deployment of new services is assisted by:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Virtualization hypervisor control or private cloud management (libvirt integration). 
<li>Rapid, massively-parallelized custom configuration. 
<li>Avoidance of network dependencies. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Related to capacity is the issue of scaling services for massive available
capacity.

   <p>By scalability we mean the intrinsic capacity of a system to
handle growth. Growth in a system can occur in three ways: by the volume of input
the system must handle, in the total size of its infrastructure,
and by the complexity of the processes within it.

   <p>For a system to be called scalable, growth should proceed unhindered,
i.e. the size and volume of processing may expand without
significantly affecting the average service level per node.

   <p>Although most of us have an intuitive notion of what scalability
means, a full understanding of it is a very complex issue, mainly
because there are so many factors to take into account. One factor
that is often forgotten in considering scalability, is the human
ability to <i>comprehend</i> the system as it grows. Limitations of
comprehension often lead to over-simplification and
lowest-common-denominator standardization.

   <p>Scalability is addressed in a separate document: <i>Scale and Scalability</i>,
so we shall not discuss it further here.

<i>Easy</i> is about barriers to adoption. If there is a cost associated with
moving ahead that makes it hard:

     <ul>
<li>A psychological cost
<li>A cognitive cost
<li>It takes too long
<li>It costs too much money
</ul>

   <p><i>Simple</i> is about what happens next. Once you have started, what happens if you
want to change something?

   <p>Total cost of ownership is reduced if a design is simple, as there are
only a few things to learn in total. Even if those things are hard to
learn, it is a one-off investment and everything that follows will be easy.

   <p>Unlike some tools, with CFEngine, you do not need to program `how' to
do things, only what you want to happen. This is always done by using the
same kinds of declarations, based on the same model. You don't
need to learn new principles and ideas, just more of the same.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>In the past<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a>, it was common to manage change by making
everything the same. Today, the individualized <i>custom experience</i>
is what today's information-society craves.  Being forced into a
single mold is a hindrance to adaptability and therefore to
agility. To put it another way, in the modern world of commerce, consumers
rule the roost, and agility is competitive edge in a market of many
more players than before.

   <p>Of course, it is not quite that simple. Today, we live in a culture of
`ease', and we focus on what can be done easily (low initial
investment) rather than worrying about long term simplicity (Total
Cost of Ownership).

   <p>At CFEngine, we believe that `easy' answers often suffer from the sin
of over-simplification, and can lead to risky practices. After all, anyone can make
something appear superficially easy by papering over a mess, or applying raw
effort, but this will not necessarily scale up cheaply over time. 
Moreover, making a risky process `too easy' can encourage haste and
carelessness.

Making something truly simple is a very hard problem, but it is an
investment in future change. What is easy today might be expensive to make easy tomorrow. 
But if something is truly simple, then the work is all up front in learning
the basics, and does not come
as an unexpected surprise down the line.

   <p>At CFEngine, we believe in agility through simplicity, and so we
invest continuous research into making our technology genuinely simple for trained
users. We know that a novice user will not necessarily find CFEngine easy, but
after a small amount of training, CFEngine will be a tool for life, not just a hurried
deployment.

   <p>Simplicity in CFEngine is addressed in the following ways:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>The software has few dependencies that complicate installation and upgrading. 
<li>Changes made are atomic and minimize dependencies. 
<li>Each host works as an independent entity, reducing communication fragility. 
<li>The configuration model is based on Promise Theory &ndash; a very consistent and simple
approach to modelling autonomous cooperative systems. 
<li>All hosts run the same software agents on all operating
platforms (from mobile phones to mainframes), and understand a single common language of intent, which they can translate into native system calls. So there are few exceptions
to deal with. 
<li>Comprehensive facilities are allowed for making use of patterns and other total-information-reducing tactics. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
A certain level of complexity might be necessary and desirable &ndash; complexity is relative. 
Some organizations still try to remain agile by avoiding complexity. However, the ability
to respond to complex scenarios often requires us to dabble with diversity. Avoiding
it merely creates a lack of agility, as one is held back by the need to
over-simplify.

<h3 class="section">3.3 An effective understanding helps agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

All configuration issues, including fitness for purpose, boil down to
three things: why, what and how. Knowing why we do something is the
most important way of avoiding error and risk of failure. Simplicity
then comes from keeping the `what' and the `how' separate, and
reducing the how to a predictable, repairable transaction. This is
what CFEngine's <i>convergent promise</i> technology does.

   <p>Knowledge is an antidote to uncertainty. Insight into patterns, brings
simplicity to the information management, and insight into behaviour
allows us to estimate impact of change, thus avoiding the risk associated
with agility.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In configuration `what' represents transitory knowledge, while `how'
is often more lasting and can be absorbed into the infrastructure. The
consistency and repairability of `how' makes it simpler to change what
without risk.

<h3 class="section">3.4 Maximizing business imperatives</h3>

<p>Agility allows companies and public services to compete and address
the needs of continuous service improvement. This requires insight
into IT operations from business and vice versa. Recently, the
`DevOps' movement in web arenas has emphasized the need for a more
streamlined approach to integrating business-driven change and IT
operations. Whatever we choose to call this, and in whatever arena,
`connecting the dots between business and IT' is a major enabler for
agility to business imperatives.

   <p>Some business issues are inherently complex, e.g. software
customization and security, because they introduce multifaceted
conflicts of interest that need to resolved with clear documentation
about <i>why</i>.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Be careful about choosing a solution because it has a low initial
outlay cost. Look to the long term cost, or the Total Cost of Ownership
over the next 5 years.

   <p>Many businesses have used the argument: <i>everything is getting cheaper
so it doesn't matter if my software is inefficient &ndash; I can brute force
it in a year's time with more memory and a faster CPU.</i> The flaw in this
argument is that complexity and scale are also increasing, and you will
need those savings down the line even more than you do now.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
The ability to model our intentions in a clearly
understandable way enables insight and understanding; this, in turn,
allows us to anticipate and comprehend challenges. CFEngine's
knowledge management features help to make the configuration itself a
part of the documentation of the system. Instead of relying on command line tools
to interact, the user documents intentions (as `promises to be kept'). 
These promises, and how well they have been kept, can be examined either
from the original specification or in the Mission Portal.

   <p>In the industrial age, the strategy was to supply sufficient force to
a small problem in order to `control' it by brute force. In systems
today the scale and complexity are such that no such brute force
approach can seriously be expected to work. Thus one is reduced to a more even
state of affairs: learning to work with the environment `as is',
with clear expectations of what is possible and controlling only certain
parts on which crucial things depend.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine is designed to have a low Total Cost of Ownership, by being
exceptionally lightweight and conceptually simple. The investment in
CFEngine is a `learning curve' that some find daunting. Indeed, at CFEngine,
we work on reducing this initial learning curve all the time &ndash; but what
really saves you in the end is simplicity without over-simplification.

   <pre class="sp">

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
At a recent deployment in the banking sector, CFEngine replaced an incumbent software solution
where 200 machines were required to make the management infrastructure
scale to the task.

   <p>CFEngine replaced this with 3 machines, and a reduced workforce. 
After the replacement the clock-time required for system updates went
from 45 minutes to 16 seconds.

The total cost of providing for agility can be costly or it
can be cheap. By design, CFEngine aims to make scale and agility
inexpensive in the long run.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The bottom line is: you are!  Diversity and customization are basic
freedoms that user-driven services demand in today's world, and having
the agility to meet changing desires is going to be an increasingly
important and prominent feature of IT, as we delve
further into the information-based society.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Competitive edge, response to demands, in both private sector and research,

Who or what makes agility a reality? The simple answer to this
question is everyone and everything. Change is a chain of dependent
activities and the weakest link in the chain is the limiting
factor. Often, that is human knowledge, since it is the part of the
chain that we take most for granted.

   <p>CFEngine has been carefully designed to support agile operations for
the long term, by investing in knowledge management, speed and
efficiency.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Capacity is often loosely referred to as `bandwidth'
because of its connection to signal propagation in communication
science, but this is not strictly correct, as bandwidth refers to parallel
channels.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> For example, for a single coding frequency, the capacity of
a communications channel is measured in bits per second, and the
bandwidth is the number multiplied by the number of parallel
frequencies.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> If available
speed matches need, and we have the capability to make all required
changes, then we can claim exactly 100% agility. If we have less than
required, then we get a smaller number, and if we have excess speed or
changeability then we can even claim a super-efficiency.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> In the 20th century, science learned that there is no such thing as
determinism &ndash; the idea that you can guarantee an outcome absolutely. 
If you still think in such terms, you will be quickly disappointed. 
The best we can accomplish is to maximize the likelihood of a
predictable result, relative to the kind of environment in which we
work.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> In some other configuration software, assumptions are hard-coded into the tools themselves, making the outcome
undocumented.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> Other systems that claim to be deterministic simply stop with
error messages. What is the correct behaviour? Clearly, this is a subjective choice. The important thing is that your
system for change behaves in a predictable way. 
</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-7" href="#fnd-7">7</a>]</small> Two related concepts that are frequently referred to are the
classic reliability measures: Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) or
proactive health and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), speed of
recovery:
(i) If we are proactive or quick at recovering from
minor problems, larger outages can be avoided. Recovery agility plays a
role in avoiding cascade failure.

   <p>(ii) If the time to repair is long, or the repair is inaccurate, this could
result if more widespread problems. Inaccurate change or repair often leads to
attempts to `roll-back', causing further problems.

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-11" href="#fnd-11">11</a>]</small> Perhaps not just in the past. We are emerging
from an industrial era of management where mass producing everything

today personal freedom demands variety and will not tolerate such
oversimplification.</p>
