<h2 class="chapter">1 Understanding Agility</h2>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We intuitively recognize agility as the capability to respond rapidly
enough and flexibly enough to a difficult challenge. If we imagine an
animal surviving in the wild, a climber on a rock-face or a wrestler engaged in
combat, we identify the skills of <i>anticipation</i>, <i>speed</i> of response and
the ability to <i>adapt</i> or bend without breaking to meet the challenges.

     <ul>
<li>Anticipate. 
<li>Act. 
<li>Adapt. 
</ul>

   <p>In infrastructure management, agility represents the need to handle
changing demand for service, to repair an absence of service, and to
improve and deploy new services in response to changes from users and
market requirements. It is tied to economic, business or work-related
imperatives by the need to maintain a competitive lead.

   <p>The compelling event that our system must respond to might represent
danger, or merely a self-imposed deadline.  In either case, there is
generally a penalty associated with a lack of agility: a blow, a fall or
a loss.

<h3 class="section">1.1 What comprises agility?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

To understand agility, we have to understand time and the capacity for change. Agility is a
relative concept: it's about adapting fast enough, in the right context. 
Let's try to gain an engineering perspective on agility to see what
enables it and what throttles it.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In a challenge there are four stages that need attention:

     <ul>
<li>To comprehend the challenge. 
<li>To solve the challenge. 
<li>To respond to the challenge. 
<li>To confirm or verify the response. 
</ul>
   </td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Each of these phases takes actual clock-time and requires a certain flexibility. 
Our goal is to keep these phases simple and therefore cheap for the long-term. 
Affording the time and flexibility needed is the key to being agile. 
Technology can help with this, if we adopt sound practices.

   <p>We can go
one step further and define an engineering scale of agility as the
ratio of available speed to required speed and ratio of number ways a
system can be changed to the number of ways imperatives require us to
change.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">
  Agility ~ Available speed under control        Changes available
           -----------------------------  *  -----------------------
                  Required speed                 Changes Required
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">Although such a scale might be hard to track in practice,
the definition makes simple engineering sense<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and brings
some insight into what we need to think about. 
What it suggests is that agility is a combination of <i>speed</i> and <i>precision</i>.

</div>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Speed</h3>

<p>What is required speed?  It is is the rate of change we have to be
able to enact in order to achieve and maintain a state (keep a
promise) that is aligned with our intent.  This requires a dependence
on technology and human processes. 
The weakest link in any chain of dependencies limits the speed. 
The weakest link might be a human who doesn't understand what to do, or a
broken wire or a misconfigured switch, so there are many
possible failure modes for agility. An organization is an information
rich <i>society</i> with complex interplays between Man and Machine; agility
challenges us to think about these weakest links and try to bolster
them with CFEngine's technology.

   <p>For example:

     <ul>
<li>If we think in terms of
services, it is the Service Level you have to achieve in order to
comply with a Service Level Agreement.

     <li>If we think of a support
ticket, it is the speed we have to work at in order to keep the impact
of an unpredicted change within acceptable levels. 
</ul>

   <p>What we call `acceptable'
is a subjective judgement, i.e. a matter for policy to decide. So
there are many uncertainties and relativisms in such definitions. It would
be inconceivable to claim any kind of industry standard for these.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="agility.png" alt="agility.png"></div>
<div align="center">How agility depends on technology measures.</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>The available maximum speed of any system is usually called its `capacity'. 
We can write some scaling laws for the dependencies of agility to see where
the failure modes might arise.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">      Average available speed ~ Expected capacity * reliability
                                ----------------------------
                                           Consumers
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
This expression says that the rate at which we get work done on average depends
no only on how we share maximum capacity amongst a number of different consumers,
clients, processes, etc, but also on how much of the time this capacity is fully
available, perhaps because systems are down or unavailable.

   <p>The appearance of reliability in this expression therefore tells us that maintenance
of the system, and anticipation of failure will play a key role in agility. 
Remarkably this is usually unexpected for most practitioners, and most of system planning
goes into first time deployment, rather than maintaining operational state.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Precision</h3>

<p>Acting quickly is not enough: we also need to be accurate in responding to
change. We need to be able to:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Formulate course-corrections quickly (requiring knowledge or insight). 
<li>Model the desired outcome accurately in terms of universal policy coordinates: Why, When, Where, What, How. 
<li>Maximize the chance that the promised outcome will be achieved. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In the 20th century, science learned that there is no such thing as
determinism &ndash; the idea that you can guarantee an outcome absolutely. 
If you still think in such terms, you will be quickly disappointed.  The best
we can accomplish is to maximize the likelihood of a predictable
result, relative to the kind of environment in which we
work. Precision is maximized when:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Policy is able to model or describe the desired state accurately. 
<li>If any assumptions are hidden, they are described by your model, not by the software<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

     <li>The agent executes the details of the model quickly and verifiably,
in a partially unpredictable environment, i.e. it should be fault tolerant. 
<li>If the model cannot be implemented, it is possible to determine why
and decide whether the problem lies in an incorrect assumption or a flaw in the implementation. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine is a fault tolerant system &ndash; it continues to work on what it
can even when some parts of its model don't work out as
expected. Other systems that pretend determinism simply stop with
error messages. What is the correct behaviour?

   <p>Clearly, this is a subjective choice. The important thing is that your
system for change behaves in a predictable way.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Comprehension</h3>

<p>The next challenge is concerns a human limitation. One of the greatest challenges in any
organization lies in comprehending the system.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">       Comprehensibility ~  Predictability (Reliability)

</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Our ability to comprehend behaviour depends on how predictable it is, i.e. 
how well it meets our expectations. For technology, we expect behaviour
to be as close as possible on our intentions. CFEngine's maintenance of promises
ensures that this is done with best possible effort and a rapid cycle of checking.

   <p>To keep the number of rules to a minimum, CFEngine avoids mixing up
<i>what</i> policy is being expressed with <i>how</i> the promises are
kept. It uses a declarative language to separate the what from the
how. This allows ordinary users to see what was intended without
having to know the meaning of how, as was the case when scripting was
used to configure systems.

<h3 class="section">1.5 Efficiency</h3>

<p>Finally, if we think about the efficiency of a configuration, which is
another way of estimating its simplicity, we are interested in how
much work it takes to represent our intentions. 
There are two ways we can think about efficiency: the efficiency
of the automated process and the human efficiency in deploying it.

   <p>The efficiency of the technology decreases with the more resources
it uses. If the technology has a high overhead, the cost of maintaining
change is high and efficiency is low:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">             Efficiency ~  1 - Resources used
                               ---------------
                               Total resources
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
It is a design goal of CFEngine to maintain minimal overhead in
all situations. The second aspect of efficiency is how much planning
or rule-making is needed to manage the relevant issues.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="verbatim">             Efficiency ~  Number of objects affected
                           ----------------------------
                                Number of rules
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Patterns play a role too in simplifying. If we make good use of
patterns, we can make few rules that cover many cases. If there are no
discernible patterns, every special case is a costly exception.  This
affects not just the technology cost, but also the cognitive cost
(comprehensibility).

   <p>Efficiency therefore lies in the power of the model to encapsulate needs with
few rules. In the underlying technology, this represents an ability to
encapsulate and represent patterns without losing flexibility. Making
black boxes is easy, but using flexible or programmable boxes is
simple. CFEngine's design goal is to provide strong modelling capabilities
that allow users to apply a small set of principles to any case, without
needing to code special methods to implement.

   <p>From the perspective of agility, regular scheduling of a verifiable
and comprehensible configuration model, combined with speed of
verification and repair are the values we covet for agility.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Aspects of CFEngine that bring agility</h2>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We can now summarize some qualities of CFEngine that favour agility:
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Ability to express clear intentions about desired outcome (comprehension). 
<li>Availability of insight into system performance and state (comprehension). 
<li>Ability to accurately customize policy down to a low level without programming (adaptability).

     <li>The default, parallelized execution framework verifies promises every 5 minutes
for rapid fault detection and change deployment. 
<li>A quick system monitoring/sampling rate &ndash; every 2.5 minutes (Nyquist frequency),
for automated hands-free response to errors. 
<li>The lightweight resource footprint of CFEngine that consumes few system resources
required for actual business (low overhead, maximum capacity).

     <li>Ability to increase number of clients without significant penalty (scalability and ease of increasing capacity).

<h3 class="section">2.1 What agility means in different environments</h3>

<p>Agility is relative to an environment.  In the following sections, we
cite the remarks of CFEngine users (in quotes), and about a few example
environments and how their expectations for agility might differ,
noting some aspects of CFEngine that are helpful in these cases.

   <p>Two concepts that are frequently referred to are the classic
reliability measures: Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To
Repair (MTTR). Although this is a simplistic model of failure, it is
easily recognizable:

     <ul>
<li>If we are proactive or quick at recovering from
minor problems, larger outages can be avoided. Thus agility plays a
role in avoiding cascade failure.

     <li>If the time to repair is long, or the repair is inaccurate, this could
result if more widespread problems. Inaccurate change or repair often leads to
attempts to `roll-back', causing further problems. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Desktop management</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
The desktop space can be a very volatile environment. Speed is
essential when there is a need to respond to a security threat that
affects all of the desktop systems; e.g. when dealing with malware
that requires the distribution of updated <samp><span class="file">virus.dat</span></samp> files,
etc. CFEngine can be very helpful by automating the process of
distributing and restarting the application responsible for virus
detection and mitigation. Systems that have been breached, need to be
returned to known and secure state quickly to avoid loss. CFEngine can
quickly detect and correct host based intrusions using file-scanning
techniques and can secure hosts for examination, or just repair them
quickly.

     <p>Another case for agility lies in user request processing. For example,
when a new user joins a workplace and needs resources such as desktop,
laptop, phone, Internet connection, VPN connection, VM instances,
etc. Speed is of the essence to minimize employee downtime.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>
Precision is important to ensure that the resources made available are
indeed the correct ones. Inaccuracy can be a potential security issue,
or merely a productivity question.

     <p>Precision also comes into play when an enterprise rolls out new
patches or productivity upgrades. These upgrades need to be uniformly
and precisely distributed to all of the desktop systems during a given
change window. By design, desktop clients running CFEngine
automatically check for changes in system state and can precisely
propagate desired state. In the case of system restoration due to
corruption or hardware failure, CFEngine can greatly reduce the time
needed to return to the most current enterprise build.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Web shops</h4>

<p>Modern web-based companies often base their entire financial
operations around an active web site. Down-time of the web service is
mission critical.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
The frequency of maintenance is not usually critical in web shops,
since configuration changes can be planned to occur over hours rather
than minutes.  During software updates and system repairs, however,
speed and orchestration are issues, as time lost during upgrades is
often revenue lost, and a lack of coordination of multiple parts could
cause effective downtime.

     <p>It is therefore easy to scale the management of a web service, as change
is rarely considered to be time-critical.

     <p>Resource availability for the web service is an issue on busy web
servers, however web services are typically quite slow already and it
is easy to load balance a web service, so resource efficiency of the
management software is not usually considered a high priority, until
the possible savings become significant with thousands of hosts.

     <p>Credit card information is subject to PCI-DSS regulation and requires
a continuous verification for auditing purposes, but these systems are
often separated from the main web service. Speed of execution can be seen
as an advantage by some auditors where repairs to security matters and
detection of breaches are carefully monitored.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>
The level of customization in a web shop could be quite high, as there
is a stack of interdependent services including databases and name
services that have to work seamlessly, and the rate of deployment of
new versions of the software might be relatively high.

     <p>Customization and individuality is a large part of a website's business
competitiveness. Maintaining precise

<p>High Performance clusters are typically found in the oil and gas
industry, in movie, financial, weather and aviation industries, and
any other modelling applications where raw computation is used to
crunch numbers.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Speed:</i><dd>
The lightweight footprint of CFEngine is a major benefit here, as
every CPU cycle and megabyte of memory is precious, so workflow is not
disrupted.

     <p>`A single node in the compute grid being out of sync with the others
can cause the entire grid to cause failed jobs or otherwise introduce
unpredictability into the environment, as it may produce results that
differ from its peers.  Thus it is imperative that repairs to an
incorrect state happen as soon as possible, to minimize the impact of
these issues.'

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>`Precision is exquisitely important in an HPC grid.  When making a
configuration change, due to the homogeneity of the environment, small
changes can have enormous impacts due to the quantity of affected
systems.  I liken this to the "monoculture" problem in replanted
forests &ndash; everything is the same, so what would ordinarily be a
small, easily-contained problem like a fungus outbreak, quickly
spreads into an uncontrollable disaster.  Thus, with HPC systems it is
imperative that any changes deployed are precise, to ensure that no
unintended consequences will occur.  This is clearly directly related
to comprehensibility of the environment &ndash; it is difficult or
impossible to make a precise change when you don't fully comprehend
the environment.'

One of the key factors in finance is liability. Fear of error, has led
to very slow processing of change.

     <p>High availability in CFEngine is used for continuous auditing and
security. Passing regulatory frameworks like SOX, SAS-70, ISO 20k, etc
can depend on this non-intrusive availability. Liability is a major
concern and significant levels of approval are generally required to
make changes, with tracking of individual responsibility. Out-of-hours
change windows are common for making upgrades and making intended
changes. Scalability of reporting is a key here, but change happens
slowly.

     <br><dt><i>Precision:</i><dd>
Security and hence tight control of approved software are major challenges
in government regulated institutions. Agility has been a low priority
in the past, but this will have to change as the rest of the world's

Manufacturing is a curious mix of all the mention areas and more. In

     <p>Not only do we need to ensure agility, but also the accuracy of

digital equivalent of the steam whistle to stop the line.

     <p>From there, all the tool information is fed upstream to servers, from
there to databases, then reports, that statistical analysis, and so
on. Each piece needs to move with the product and incorporate it. It

relevant.

     <p>Not only do you have the security requirements, from virus updates to
top secret classification, but these tools need to never stop,
ever. Also, these tools need constant reconfiguration depending on the
product they are working on: e.g. you can't use the same set of
procedures on XBox chip as a cellphone memory module. And all the
tools are different too: one may be a probe to detect microscopic
fractures in the layers, one tool may just track it's position in

<h3 class="section">2.2 Separating What from How</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Many programmatic systems and `APIs' force you to explain how
something will be accomplished and the statement about `what' the
outcome will be is left to an implicit assumption. Such systems are
called imperative systems.

   <p>CFEngine is a declarative system. In a declarative system, the reverse
is true. You begin by writing down What you are trying to accomplish
and the How is more implicit. The way this is done is by separating
data from algorithm in the model. CFEngine encourages this with its
language, but you can go even further by using the tools optimally.

   <p>CFEngine allows you to represent raw data as variables, or as
strings within your policy. For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     bundle agent name
     {
     vars:
     
       "main_server" string =&gt; "abc.123.com";
     
       "package_source[ubuntu]" string =&gt; "repository.ubuntu.com";
       "package_source[suse]"   string =&gt; "repository.suse.com";
     
      # Promises that use these data
      #
      # packages:
      # processes:
      # files:
      # services: , etc
     
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">By separating `what' data like this out of the details of how
they are used, it becomes easier to comprehend and locate, and it
becomes fast to change, and the accuracy of the change is easily
perceived. Moreover, CFEngine can track the impact of such a change by
seeing where the data are used.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine's knowledge management can tell you which system promises
depend on which data in a clear manner, so you will know the impact
of a change to the data. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>You can also keep data outside your policy in databases, or sources like:

     <ul>
<li>LDAP
<li>NIS
<li>DNS
<li>System files
</ul>

<p class="noindent">For example, reading in data from a system file is very convenient. 
This is what Unix-like system do for passwords and user management.

<pre class="smallexample"></pre>
   <p>What you might lose when making an input matrix is the <i>why</i>. 
Is there an explanation that fits all these cases, or does each
case need a special explanation? We recommend that you include
as much information as possible about `why'.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Packaging limits agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>Atomicity, or avoidance of dependency, is a key approach to simplicity. 
Today this is often used to argue to packaging of software.

   <p>Handling software and system configuration as packages of data makes
certain processes appear superficially easy, because you get a single object
to deal with, that has a name and a version number. 
However, to maintain flexibility we should
not bundle too many features into a package.

   <p>For example, a tin of
soup or a microwave meal might be a superficially easy way to make
dinner, for many scenarios, but the day you get a visitor with special
dietary requirements (vegetarian or allergic etc) then the
prepackaging is a major obstacle to adapting: the recipe cannot be
changed and repackaged without going back to the factory that made
it. Thus oversimplification generally tends to end up sending up back
to work around the technology.

   <p>CFEngine's modelling language gives you control over the smallest
ingredients, but also allows you to package your own containers
or work with other suppliers' packages. This ensures that
adaptability is not sacrificed for superficial ease.

   <p>For example: your system's package model can cooperate with
CFEngine make asking CFEngine to promise to work with the
package manager:

<pre class="verbatim">
packages:

  "apache2";
  "php5";
  "opera";

</pre>

<p class="noindent">If you need to change what happens under the covers, it
is very simple to do this in CFEngine. You can copy the details
of the existing methods, because the details are not hard-coded,
and you can make your own custom version quickly.
<pre class="verbatim">
packages:

  "apache2"  

    package_method => my_special_package_manager_interface;

<h3 class="section">2.4 How abstraction improves agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Abstraction allows us to turn special cases into general patterns. This leads to a compression
of information, as we can make defaults for the general patterns, which do not have to be
repeated each time.

   <p>Service promises are good example of this<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, for example:

<pre class="verbatim">services:

  "www";
 
</pre>
In this promise, all of the details of what happens to turn on the
web service have been hidden behind this simple identifier &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">www</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This looks easy, but is it simple?

   <p>In this case, it is both easy and simple. Let's check why.  We have to
ask the question: how does this abstraction improve speed and precision
in the long run?

   <p>Obviously, it provides short term ease by allowing many complex
operations to take place with the utterance of just a single
word<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>. But any
software can pull that smoke and mirrors trick. To be agile, it must
be possible to understand and change the details of what happens when
this services is promised. Some tools hard-code processes for this kind
of statement, requiring an understanding of programming in a
development language to alter the result. In CFEngine, the definitions
underlying this are written in the high-level declarative CFEngine
language, using the same paradigm, and can therefore be altered by the
users who need the promise, with only a small amount of work.

   <p>Thus, simplicity is assured by having consistency of interface
and low cost barrier to changing the meaning of the definition.

<h3 class="section">2.5 Increasing capacity (increasing scale)</h3>

<p>Capacity in IT infrastructure is increased by increasing machine
power. Today, at the limit of hardware capacity, this typically means
increasing the number of machines serving a task. Cloud services have
increased the speed agility with which resources can be deployed &ndash;
whether public or private cloud &ndash;
but they do not usually provide any customization tools.  This is
where CFEngine brings significant value.

   <p>The rapid deployment of new services is assisted by:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Virtualization hypervisor control or private cloud management (libvirt integration). 
<li>Rapid, massively-parallelized custom configuration. 
<li>Avoidance of network dependencies. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Related to capacity is the issue of scaling services for massive available
capacity.

   <p>By scalability we mean the intrinsic capacity of a system to
handle growth. Growth in a system can occur in three ways: by the volume of input
the system must handle, in the total size of its infrastructure,
and by the complexity of the processes within it.

   <p>For a system to be called scalable, growth should proceed unhindered,
i.e. the size and volume of processing may expand without
significantly affecting the average service level per node.

   <p>Although most of us have an intuitive notion of what scalability
means, a full understanding of it is a very complex issue, mainly
because there are so many factors to take into account. One factor
that is often forgotten in considering scalability, is the human
ability to <i>comprehend</i> the system as it grows. Limitations of
comprehension often lead to over-simplification and
lowest-common-denominator standardization.

   <p>Scalability is addressed in a separate document: <i>Scale and Scalability</i>,
so we shall not discuss it further here.

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Just as we separate goals from actions, and strategy from tactics,
so we can separate what is easy from what is simple. Easy brings
short-term gratification, but simple makes the future cost less.

   <pre class="sp">

<i>Easy</i> is about barriers to adoption. If there is a cost associated with
moving ahead that makes it hard:

     <ul>
<li>A psychological cost
<li>A cognitive cost
<li>It takes too long
<li>It costs too much money
</ul>

   <p><i>Simple</i> is about what happens next. Once you have started, what happens if you
want to change something?

   <p>Total cost of ownership is reduced if a design is simple, as there are
only a few things to learn in total. Even if those things are hard to
learn, it is a one-off investment and everything that follows will be easy.

   <p>Unlike some tools, with CFEngine, you do not need to program `how' to
do things, only what you want to happen. This is always done by using the
same kinds of declarations, based on the same model. You don't
need to learn new principles and ideas, just more of the same.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>In the past<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>, it was common to manage change by making
everything the same. Today, the individual custom experience is what today's information
society craves.  Being forced into a single mold is a hindrance to
adaptability and therefore to agility. In the world of commerce,
consumers rule the roost, and agility is competitive edge in a market of
many more players than before.

   <p>Today, we live in a culture of `ease', and we focus on what can be
done easily rather than worrying about long term simplicity (Total Cost
of Ownership). At CFEngine, we believe that `easy' answers often suffer from
oversimplification issues. Anyone can make something appear superficially
easy by working hard on behalf of a user, or by papering  over a mess. 
Moreover, making a risky process `too easy' can encourage haste and
carelessness.

   <p>Any problem has an intrinsic complexity, which can be measured by the
smallest number of information required to solve it.

   <pre class="sp">

Ease is the absence of a psychological barrier to acting.

</pre>

Making something truly simple is a very hard problem, but it is an
investment in future change. What is easy today might be expensive to make easy tomorrow. 
But if something is truly simple, then the work is all up front in learning
the basics, and does not come
as an unexpected surprise down the line.

   <p>At CFEngine, we believe in agility through simplicity, and so we
invest continuous research into making our technology genuinely simple for trained
users. We know that a novice user will not necessarily find CFEngine easy, but
after a small amount of training, CFEngine will be a tool for life, not just a hurried
deployment.

   <p>Simplicity in CFEngine is addressed in the following ways:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>The software has few dependencies that complicate installation and upgrade. 
<li>Changes made are atomic and minimize dependencies. 
<li>Each host works as an independent entity, reducing communication fragility. 
<li>The configuration model is based on Promise Theory &ndash; a very consistent and simple
approach to modelling autonomous cooperative systems. 
<li>All hosts run a basically identical agent on all operating
platforms (from mobile phones to mainframes), and understand a common language of intent which they
can translate into any operating system's naive system calls. 
<li>Comprehensive facilities are allowed for making use of patterns and other total-information-reducing
tactics. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
A certain level of complexity is necessary and desirable. 
Some organizations still try to remain agile by avoiding complexity. However, the ability
to respond to complex scenarios often requires us to delve into complexity. Avoiding
it merely creates a lack of agility as we are constrained by the requirement of
oversimplification.

<h3 class="section">3.3 An effective understanding helps agility</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

All configuration issues, including fitness for purpose, boil down to
three things: why, what and how. Knowing why we do something is the
most important way of avoiding error and risk of failure. Simplicity
then comes from keeping the `what' and the `how' separate, and
reducing the how to a predictable, repairable transaction. This is
what CFEngine's <i>convergent promise</i> technology does.

   <p>Knowledge is an antidote to uncertainty. Insight into patterns, brings
simplicity to the information management, and insight into behaviour
allows us to estimate impact of change, thus avoiding the risk associated
with agility.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In configuration `what' represents transitory knowledge, while `how'
is often more lasting and can be absorbed into the infrastructure. The

<h3 class="section">3.4 Maximizing business imperatives</h3>

<p>Agility allows companies and public services to compete and address
the needs of continuous service improvement. This requires insight
into IT operations from business and vice versa. Recently, the
`DevOps' movement in web arenas has emphasized the need for a more
streamlined approach to integrating business-driven change and IT
operations. Whatever we choose to call this, and in whatever arena,
`connecting the dots between business and IT' is a major enabler for
agility to business imperatives.

   <p>Some business issues are inherently complex, e.g. software
customization and security, because they introduce multifaceted
conflicts of interest that need to resolved with clear documentation
about <i>why</i>.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Be careful about choosing a solution because it has a low initial
outlay cost. Look to the long term cost, or the Total Cost of Ownership
over the next 5 years.

   <p>Many businesses have used the argument: everything is getting cheaper
so it doesn't matter if my software is inefficient &ndash; I can brute force
it in a year's time with more memory and a faster CPU. The error of this
argument is that complexity and scale are also increasing, and you will
need those savings down the line even more than you do now. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>The ability to model our intentions about these matters in a clearly
understandable way enables insight and understanding; this, in turn,
allows us to anticipate and comprehend challenges. CFEngine's
knowledge management features help to make the configuration itself a
documentation of the system. Instead of relying on command line tools
to interact, the user documents intentions (as `promises to be kept'). 
These promises, and how well they have been kept, can be examined either
from the original specification or in the Mission Portal.

   <p>In the industrial age, the strategy was to supply sufficient force to
a small problem in order to `control' it by brute force. In systems
today the scale and complexity are such that no such brute force
approach can seriously be expected to work. Thus one is reduced to a more even
state of affairs: learning to work with the environment `as is',
with clear expectations of what is possible and controlling only certain
parts on which crucial things depend.

The architecture of CFEngine is designed to be lightweight and have a low
Total Cost of Ownership.

   <p>While speed and scalability might not seem important for certain
environments, and brute force methods will indeed work with sufficient
force, such methods are costly.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
At a recent site, CFEngine replaced an incumbent software solution
where 200 machines were required to make the management infrastructure
scale to the task. CFEngine replaced this with 3 machines, and a
reduced workforce. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>Clearly the total cost of providing for agility can be costly or it
can be cheap. By design, CFEngine aims to make scale and agility
inexpensive in the long run.

<h3 class="section">3.6 Who is responsible for agility?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Agility is going to be an increasingly important and prevalent feature
of the modern world, as we enter the information-based
society. Competitiveness edge in both private sector and research
makes agility the actual product of a not-too-distant tomorrow.

   <p>Who or what makes agility a reality? The simple answer to this
question is everyone and everything. Change is a chain of dependent
activities and the weakest link in the chain is the limiting
factor. Often, that is human knowledge, since it is the part of the
chain that we take most for granted.

   <p>CFEngine has been carefully designed to support agile operations for
the long term, by investing in knowledge management, speed and efficiency. 
We recommend all infrastructure engineers to reexamine the role of time in
their systems.

   <p>Tempus fugit!

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> If available
speed matches need, and we have the capability to make all required
changes, then we can claim exactly 100% agility. If we have less than
required, then we get a smaller number, and if we have excess speed or
changeability then we can even claim a super-efficiency.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> In some other configuration software, assumptions are hard-coded into the tools themselves, making the outcome
undocumented.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> Service promises,
as described here, were introduced into version 3.3.0 of CFEngine in
2012.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> All good magic stories begin like this.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> Perhaps not just in the past. We are emerging
from an industrial era of management where mass producing everything
the same was the cheapest approach to scaling up services. However,
today personal freedom demands variety and will not tolerate such
oversimplification.</p>
