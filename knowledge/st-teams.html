<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is team-work?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Team work is a collaboration between individuals with different
skills. It is key element in decentralized organization &ndash; both for
humans and computers.

   <p>Teams exist for efficiency (divide and conquer by skill) and also
because because humans need continual motivation and emotional support
which sustains work-flow and adds creativity to work.

   <p>The team-aspect of management is often overlooked in favour of
top-down hierarchical design (do what the boss tells you). CFEngine
does not force us into hierarchical systems however;
the team analogy is more appropriate for CFEngine's
model of voluntary cooperation.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="hierarchy.png" alt="Hierarchy has long traditions but modern thinking favours teams."></div>

   <p>IT management is complex, so it makes sense to delegate
responsibility for different issues.  An organization will generally
consist of many groups and teams already, each with their own special
needs and each craving its own autonomy. CFEngine and promise theory
were designed for precisely this kind of environment. CFEngine allows
cooperation and sharing without allowing central managers to ride
roughshod over local needs.

   <p>Teams thrive by discussion and interaction within the framework of a
policy or vision, allowing variation and arriving at a consensus when
necessary. Success in a team depends on a combination of abilities
working together not undermining one another. Conflicts in the
promises made by team members reveal design problems in the group. An
analysis of promises (CFEngine's model of collaboration) is a
significant tool for understanding and enabling teams.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creative roles</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

M. Belbin, a researcher in teamwork has identified nine abilities or
roles (kinds of promise) to be played in a team collaboration (regardless
of how many people there are in the team):

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Plant &ndash; a creative &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; person who solves problems.

     <li>Shaper &ndash; this is a dynamic member of the team who thrives on
pressure and has the drive and courage to overcome obstacles.

     <li>Specialist &ndash; someone who brings specialist knowledge to the group.

     <li>Implementer &ndash; a practical thinker who is rooted in reality and can turn ideas into
practice (who sometimes frustrates more imaginative high flying
visionaries).

     <li>Resource Investigator &ndash; an enabler, or someone who knows where to
find the help the team needs regardless of whether the help is
physical, financial or human. This person is good at networking.

     <li>Chairman/Co-ordinator &ndash; an arbitrator who makes sure that
everyone gets their say and can contribute.

     <li>Monitor-Evaluator &ndash; is a dispassionate, discerning member who can
judge progress and achievement accurately during the process.

     <li>Team Worker &ndash; someone concerned with the team's inter-personal
relationships and who is sensitive to the atmosphere of the group.

     <li>Completer/Finisher &ndash; someone critical and analytical who looks after the details of
presentation and spots potential flaws and gaps. The completer is
a quality control person.
        </ol>

   <p>His model leaves little room for technical workflow arguments. It is
entirely concerned with the creative process. This is probably
significant.  We should ask ourselves: how can we use the freedom to
organize into specialized teams to maximize human creativity, while
passing hard work over to machines. Solving this problem is what
CFEngine is about.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Delegating roles in a collaboration</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

We need to delegate responsiblity to divide and conquer a problem, both when
designing policy for computers and when making work schedules for humans. But how
can we be certain different parties will not interfere with one
anothers' responsibilities? The bottom line is that we cannot be certain
without oversight and coordination.

   <p>Promise theory shows that coordination needs a single
point of coordination to be the arbiter of correctness in any collaborative
process: a so-called `checkpoint' or `team leader', like passport
control at an airport. This checkpoint has to examine each
contribution to the team and look for conflicts.

   <p>For humans, this might be a matter of communication by meeting.  CFEngine,
on the other hand, has no built-in meta-access control mechanism which
can decide who may write policy rules. To create such a mechanism,
there would have to be a monitor which could identify users, and an
authority mechanism that would disallow certain users to write rules
of certain types about certain objects on certain hosts.

   <p>CFEngine Community Edition has <code>roles</code> promises, which offer a
partial solution, but it does not address the core issue which is that
collaboration in change requires freedom to act, not restriction. 
Delegation therefore requires trust. CFEngine Nova and Constellation
have `hubs' which can be coordinate large numbers of
hosts. Coordination can also be pre-arranged as policy, so that
everyone has their own copy of the script. This is how an orchestra
scales, for instance.

   <p>To keep matters as simple as possible, CFEngine avoids this kind of
technical coordination as much as possible and proposes a different
approach, using policy along with a social contract between
the collaborating teams. Promise theory allows us to model the collaborative security
implications of this (see the figure of the bow-tie structure). A
simple method of delegating is the following.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Delegate responsibility for different issues to admin teams 1,2,3, etc. 
<li>Make each of these teams responsible for version control of their own
configuration rules. 
<li>Make an intermediate agent responsible for collating and vetting the rules, checking for
irregularities and conflicts. This agent must promise to disallow rules by
one team that are the responsibility of another team. The agent could be a
layer of software, but a cheaper and more manageable solution is the make this
another group of one or more humans.

     <li>Make the resulting collated configuration version controlled. Publish
approved promises for all hosts to download from a trusted source.

        </ol>

   <p>A review procedure for policy-promises is a good solution if you want
to delegate responsibility for different parts of a policy to
different sources. Human judgement as the `arbiter' is irreplaceable,
but tools can be added to make conflicts easier to detect.

   <p>Promise theory underlines that, if a host or computing device accepts
policy from any source, then it is alone and entirely responsible for
this decision. The ultimate responsibility for the published version
policy is the vetting agent. This creates a shallow hierarchy, but
there is no reason why this formal body could not be comprised of
representatives from the multiple teams.

   <p>The figure below shows how a number of policy authoring teams can work together
safely and securely to write the policy for a number of hosts, by vetting through
a checkpoint, in a classic `bow-tie' formation.
