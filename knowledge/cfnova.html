<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 CFEngine is agent based software</h4>

<p>CFEngine is agent based software. It resides on and runs processes on
each individual computer under its management. That means you do not
need to grant any security credentials for login to CFEngine. Instead, for
normal operation, CFEngine runs in privileged `root' or
`Administrator' mode to get access to system resources and makes these
available safely to authorized inquiries.

   <p>A CFEngine installation is thus required on every machine you want to
manage: client and server, desktop or blade.  Typically, you will
single out one machine to be a <i>policy server</i> or <i>hub</i>. In very
large networks of many thousands of machines, you might need several
policy servers, i.e. several hubs.

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.2 Single point of coordination</h4>

<p>The default CFEngine Nova architecture uses a single hub or policy
server to publish changes of policy and to aggregate knowledge about
the environment, but you can set up as many as you like to manage
different parts of your organization independently.  The CFEngine
technology is not centralized by nature. Most users choose to
centralize updating of policy and report aggregation for convenience
however.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<img src="hub.pdf" alt="The front page">
<div align="center">Figure: A policy server or `hub' is implemented in CFEngine Nova</div>
<div align="center">as a simple solution that will scale for most sites `out of the box'.</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

If you operate CFEngine Nova in its default mode, the hub acts as a
server from which every other client machine can access policy
updates. It also acts as a collector, aggregating summary information
from each machine and weaving it into a knowledge map about the datacentre.

   <p>For a single hub configuration, the figure below shows a normal
process approach to managing policy. Policy is edited and developed at
a Policy Definition Point, outside of normal production
environment. This can be done using the specialized editor embedded
in CFEngine Nova, or it can be done using any text editor of your choice.

   <p>Edits are made in conjunction with a version control
repository<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which should be used to document the <i>reasons</i> for changes
to policy<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  When a
change has been tested and approved, it will be copied manually to the
policy dispatch point on one or more distribution servers. All other
machines will then download policy updates from that single location according
to their own schedule.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.3 Requirements and scalability of CFEngine Nova</h4>

<p>The default architecture and configuration skeleton is expected to
scale to a few thousand hosts with a dedicated policy hub. Your hub
machine should have at least 2 GB of memory and a modern processor. 
You will need about 2 MB of disk storage for every machine under
CFEngine's management.

   <p>CFEngine will scale to very large systems, with tens of thousands of
machines. This is only possible because of its decentralized agent-based
operation. CFEngine encourages the federation of policy in complex
environments, so that local domain experts manage what they know and
baseline policies can be handled generally for all. We also encourage
a practice of small adjustments, as opposed to large risky redesigns
of operational policy.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine's recommended practice is to encourage small incremental changes
to policy, not to save up changes into  `big project roll-outs'. This
strategy lowers the risk of error and offers improved scalability. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine will operate autonomously (hands-free) in a network, under
your guidance.  If your site is large (thousands of servers) you
should spend some time discussing with CFEngine experts how to tune
this description to your environment as <em>scale</em> requires you to
have more infrastructure, and a potentially more complicated
configuration. The essence of any CFEngine deployment is the same.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.3.4 Phases of the server life-cycle</h4>

<p>The four phases in managing systems, summarized in the Build, Deploy,
Manage, Audit (BDMA) framework originated with a model of system
management based on transactional changes (`roll-out').  CFEngine's conception of
management is some different, as transaction processing is not a good
model for highly distributed systems, but we can use this template to see how
CFEngine works differently.

     <dl>
<dt><em>Build</em><dd>CFEngine is often used together with other tools to build new machines,
whether virtual or real. You integrate it into the `kickstart' or `jumpstart'
process, using PXE network booting, etc, by including the CFEngine software
in the initial build and executing CFEngine once at the end of the installation.

     <p>To complete the installation of your system, you create a set of
promises about the system state, or policy-template of proposed
promises. When systems keep these promises, they will function
seamlessly as planned.

     <br><dt><em>Deploy</em><dd>Deploying software or changes really means implementing the policy
that has been decided.  In CFEngine you simply publish your proposed
policy and the machines can adjust accordingly.  Each installed agent
is capable of implementing policies and maintaining them over time
without further assistance.

     <br><dt><em>Manage</em><dd>Once a decision is made, unplanned events will occur. Such
incidents usually set off alarms and humans rush to make new transactions
to repair them. In CFEngine, the autonomous agent manages the system,
and you only have to deal with rare events that cannot be dealt with
automatically.

     <br><dt><em>Audit</em><dd>
Promises are assured by design in CFEngine and maintained
automatically, so the main worry when using CFEngine is whether or not
you have coded conflicting intentions. The compliance of machines
with the policy template is easily measured by CFEngine, using its
model-oriented approach. This can be viewed from the web-browsable
interface.

<p>The enhancement provide by CFEngine Nova fall into a number categories:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Business transparency and reporting enhancements, providing insight into IT operations
for both Business and IT. CFEngine Nova connects the dots between high level business goals and
low level configuration, supporting Knowledge Management for ITIL processes.

     <li>Productivity enhancements &ndash; easier getting started and making changes.

     <li>Continuity and repair related enhancements.

     <li>Full integrated Knowledge Management.

     <li>Special support for operating system features and virtualization, such as Solaris zones
and the libvirt interface.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.1 Productivity enhancements</h4>

<p>Features that are designed to make it easier to work with
CFEngine on a day to day basis.

     <ul>
<li>Simple automatic installation (one command per system)
<li>A template library of managed services for common platforms. 
<li>Auto-analyzing system knowledge console
<li>Policy mining and semantic knowledge representation
<li>Auto-classification of systems
<li>Performance and Service Level reports
<li>On- and off-line syntax look-up. 
<li>Integration with LDAP directory services. 
</ul>

   <p>The most important productivity tool is the CFEngine Mission Portal,
which contains an interface for browsing and editing policy, and
understanding it in the context of reports and a Knowledge Map of the system.

   <p>A library of managed services for common Linux operating systems is
provided as part of the knowledge base. This makes setting up specialized
service nodes a simple process of matching hosts to services from a required
list.

   <p>The ability to look up syntax on the fly, from the web or the command
line, can be save experienced users considerable time. Using the tools
for database interaction, the process of setting up a CFEngine
knowledge base at your organization is fully automated and you only
have to think about local customizations you want to make.

   <p>LDAP query functions have been added for integration with
LDAP services or Active Directory information, allowing a single
point of definition for system lists and identity management.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.2 Functional enhancements</h4>

     <ul>
<li>Database verification and editing including SQL (Mysql,Postgres)
<li>MS Registry management and repair
<li>File-system ACL security management (Linux, Windows, Solaris)
<li>Extended monitoring probes and system classification capabilities. 
</ul>

   <p>These include the ability to interact with and repair popular SQL databases
(currently MySQL and PostgreSQL), as well as embedded system databases
such as the Microsoft System Registry, defining, validating, scanning
or repairing their tabular structure and the data within them.

     <ul>
<li>Access remote CFEngine variables (like a simple directory service)
<li>LDAP directory service integration
<li>Role based access control on policy execution by class. 
</ul>

   <p>Access Control List (ACL) support for Linux is now added for pinpoint
accuracy in file permission security. CFEngine Nova's ACL support
includes a completely new generic CFEngine model for ACLs that will
translate across multiple platforms so that users can as closely as
possible translate identical requirements across multiple platforms
with different implementations.  Native ACLs are also supported.

   <p>Fault tolerant features have been added in Nova to functions for retrieval
of data from network connections. It is risky to rely of data from a
network when configuring hosts. If the network connection could fail, erroneous
data might be written to a local configuration. Nova adds local caching to
network results and works opportunistically to provide the latest known
values; however, look-up functions, such as LDAP retrieval of <code>remotescalar</code>
data will not fail.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.3 Reporting enhancements</h4>

<p>Nova can provide a wider range of system reports about information
collected by CFEngine on performance, security and state. This
includes the ability to perform custom system discovery, and log the
data into a variety of special reports.

   <pre class="sp">

     <ul>
<li>HTML, XML, CSV report generation
<li>Service and performance level reports
<li>Reliability reports
<li>Deep history analysis and visualization, through knowledge base. 
<li>Policy dependency and impact analysis reporting
</ul>

   <p>Information can be extracted in HTML, XML and text formats (e.g. CSV)
for easy integration with other presentation tools, or for direct
viewing through the knowledge console.

   <p>As part of policy-writing, CFEngine Nova allows you to track
dependencies on policy items.  The knowledge agent can take this
information, analyze it and present it as part of an overview of the
system (see the chapter on Knowledge Management for more information). 
This enables virtual impact analysees to be inspected.

<h4 class="subsection">1.4.4 Documentation enhancements</h4>

<p>Additional documentation is provided for Nova users through program
built-in help, additional manuals and integration of syntax
information into the CFEngine Knowledge Console.

   <p>An annoying aspect of any software is the need to browse through a manual
to find quick answers to questions. Ideally one would only look at manuals
during a learning phase; thereafter we want to see examples and summaries of
what we basically already know but cannot keep in our heads.

   <p>System administrators often prefer to work in the command line and
find the need to go to a manual a distraction. Indeed, if the network
is non-functional or we are working off-line, instant command line
help is a great bonus.  Other users prefer the point and click of a
familiar web interface. CFEngine Nova provides both these options to
users to provide quick answers.

   <p>Of the two, a web interface is clearly the most flexible. Far more
information can be browsed on the web than is practical with a simple
text interface. However, of the two, the command line interface is by
far the fastest way to get answers to simple questions of syntax. 
CFEngine's knowledge agent knows CFEngine's syntax tree and can
summarize it at the keyword level.

<p>CFEngine Nova is designed to be simple to install in its default configuration. The installation
process has three phases:

     <ul>
<li>Unpacking the software. 
<li>Obtaining a license. 
<li>Adapting policy. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Operating system support</h3>

<p>CFEngine can be made to run on most operating systems. For efficiency
CFEngine only supports a number of recent popular operating systems,
which should be up to date with patches. If we don't have packages for
your particular operating systems we can usually make packages by
special arrangement.

   <p>The hub (or policy server) is only available for derivatives of the
top GNU/Linux distributions (Debian, Red Hat, SuSE), as these make available
software that the hub relies on for data storage and processing. 
Operating system choices for the hub are:

<pre class="example">      Debian 5,6
      Ubuntu 8,9,10
      RedHat 4,5
      SuSE   11
</pre>
   <p>No special software is required on other machines in your
network. CFEngine bundles all dependencies in the Nova package.

   <p>Nova provides a version of CFEngine running natively on Windows, with
support for registry management, Windows services and file
security, See <a href="#Windows_002dspecific-features-in-Nova">Windows-specific features in Nova</a>. Support for Solaris zones has been added through
automated zone detection and process model adaptation.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Installing the software on a new host</h3>

<p>Nova is provided in two packages. The main software package (for each operating system) must be installed
on every host. The second package is only installed on the <i>hub</i> or <i>policy server</i>. You should install
the hub first.

   <p>On a new host, installation follows the following procedure. References to package managers
assume that additional packages might need to be installed of the policy server, e.g. the Apache
Web Server.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Verify that the machine's network connection is working and that it can resolve
names. On the hub verify that package managers <code>yum</code>, <code>zypper</code> or <code>apt-get</code> are working.

     <li>Copy the Nova packages to the system. On the hub or policy server:
     <pre class="example">          CFEngine-nova-2.<var>xxx.[rpm|deb]</var>
          CFEngine-nova-expansion-2.<var>xxx.[rpm|deb]</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">On all other machines
     <pre class="example">          CFEngine-nova-2.<var>xxx.[rpm|deb]</var>
</pre>
     <li>Unpack the software:
          <dl>
<dt><i>Red Hat family</i><dd>
          <pre class="example">               host# rpm -ihv <var>packages</var>
</pre>
          <br><dt><i>Debian family</i><dd>
          <pre class="example">               host# dpkg --install  <var>packages</var>
</pre>
          </dl>

     <li>A public key has now been created in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub</span></samp> on the policy hub as part of the
package installation. You should email this public key to CFEngine
Support, as an attachment, to obtain a license file <samp><span class="file">license.dat</span></samp>. Save the returned license
file to <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/license.dat</span></samp> on the hub before continuing.

     <li>The remaining steps apply to all hosts, but you should install the hub or policy server first. 
Find the name or IP address of the hub (policy server), here we assume &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">123.456.789.123</span></samp>&rsquo; is the address. 
<pre class="verbatim">     /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
</pre>
Use the same command on all hosts, i.e. do not bootstrap the policy
server with a localhost address. 
<li>The software should now be running.

     <li>To complete to licensing, you should make a promise to accept the license
terms by editing the <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf</span></samp> on
the policy server, and editing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host_licenses_paid =&gt; "100";</span></samp>&rsquo;
line in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">body common control</span></samp>&rsquo; to reflect the correct number of
licenses that you have subscribed to.

        </ol>

<p class="noindent"><b>How to assess success in this procedure:</b>

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Look at the process list on the systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ps waux | grep cf</span></samp>&rsquo;or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ps -ef | grep cf</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You should be able to see <code>cf-execd</code> running, and eventually other processes from the CFEngine suite like <code>cf-monitord</code>
<code>cf-serverd</code>.

     <li>Look for files in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp> (Unix)
or <samp><span class="file">X:\Program Files\CFEngine\inputs</span></samp> (Windows). The license
file will be copied out from the policy server to the clients as part
of the normal distribution of policy. Each Unix machine should get a
copy of the <samp><span class="file">license.dat</span></samp> file in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp>
(Unix) or <samp><span class="file">X:\Program Files\CFEngine\inputs</span></samp> (Windows).

     <li>The file <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/promise_knowledge.cf</span></samp> should have been
created, and should contain data.

     <li>Finally try connecting to the web server at port 80 on the hub / policy host. 
You should see a summary page like the one shown in the figure below.
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Upgrading Nova</h3>

<p>When upgrading the software from an earlier version, you should
upgrade the policy server (hub) machine first. Any other hosts
in your network that act as servers for encrypted copy operations
would preferably be upgraded first. This is because a stronger form of
encryption-hash is used in newer versions, which the older servers
cannot understand.

   <p>CFEngine packages its software in operating system compatible package
formats (RPM, PKG, MSI, etc). New packages are made available on the
software.CFEngine.com website; these can be downloaded and installed
in the standard way.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Go to the <code>software.CFEngine.com</code> website
<li>Select the version of the software you require
<li>Download the particular package for your operating systems to a
correspondingly named sub-directory on your policy server under
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/master_software_updates</span></samp>, or simply mirror the entire file
tree on your policy server under
<br>
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/master_software_updates</span></samp>.
        </ol>

     <ul>
<li>You do not need to delete the contents of the work directory, e.g. <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine</span></samp>
to upgrade. An upgrade only involves changing the binary code base.

     <li>Users are encouraged to take advantage of changes to the Nova base policy, e.g. 
the <samp><span class="file">update.cf</span></samp> policy. We have reduced the number of files distributed and managed
by CFEngine in 2.0.0. To gain the full benefits of the software, you should use the latest
versions of these files:

     <pre class="smallexample">          cdp_inputs/  CFEngine.cf         failsafe.cf     knowledge.cf  promises.cf   update.cf
          cdp_lib/     CFEngine_stdlib.cf  file_change.cf  OrionCloud/
</pre>
     <p>Note that some log files have new names, and that the audit database is no longer used
by default. If you do not upgrade the files above, make sure you rotate the log files
and perform garbage collection as detailed in these files.

     <li>You can upgrade systems manually by copying the relevant package
to the local host and running the appropriate package update command (see summary below).

     <li>To upgrade all of your systems automatically, you only need to copy a
new package release to a specially designated location on your policy
server, and CFEngine will do the rest. Each CFEngine client will
detect the presence of the update, download it, install and restart
CFEngine services locally. Thus you can deploy software using a single
point of management.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Troubleshooting upgrade</h4>

<p>You might experience some authentication errors during secure copy
operations during upgrade from older versions of Nova. These will self-repair once the servers
have been upgraded.

   <p>To avoid these altogether, you can temporarily disable copy verification,
i.e. set
<pre class="example">     verify =&gt; "false";
</pre>
   <p>in your <code>copy_from</code> bodies, should you wish. For standard
installations, this setting is typically part of the definition of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">secure_cp</span></samp>&rsquo;
defined in the <samp><span class="file">CFEngine_stdlib.cf</span></samp> file.

<h3 class="section">2.4 What is the default configuration?</h3>

<p>Following the above procedure, you should have a fully functional
CFEngine on all clients. However, in the default configuration,
CFEngine does nothing other look after itself, and look for possible
policy updates from the master file policy distribution point on the
policy server. The policy server is configured to collect data from
non-policy server machines and generate reports that are integrated
into the knowledge base.

   <p>To alter policies, you need to change the files on the policy hub,
in the directory <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp>. To begin with
most of the policy examples are commented out in these files:
   <pre class="sp">

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
To change this, you can go to the main file <samp><span class="file">promises.cf</span></samp>, and include additional
pre-made bundles of promises. You should always verify the contents of the bundles
you include before activating and deploying to new machines.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Mission Portal</h2>

<p>Knowledge management has become a new focus in IT management, and it
is a core focus at CFEngine. Comprehending the growing complexity of
IT operations is one of the main challenges in IT today. CFEngine Nova
has a number of key features for knowledge management, including
automated documentation, report generation and associative inference. The
CFEngine Mission Portal is the centerpiece of user interaction with
CFEngine Nova.

   <p>The structure of the Mission Portal interface follows the concept of a Topic Map. A
Topic Map is an ISO standard for indexing electronic information as a
<i>semantic web</i>. In a semantic web, you are presented with links to
documents about your chosen topic, as usual; in addition you are
offered <i>leads</i> and possible pathways to topics that are known to be
related. These leads don't just point you to more documents, but
explain <i>how</i> neighboring issues are related.  The aim is to help
the user learn from the experience of browsing, by conveying the
meaning of the current topic in relation to other issues in the
system. This is how <i>knowledge transfer</i> occurs.

   <pre class="sp">

There are four main categories in the mission portal:

     <ul>
<li>Mission Summary - a top level overview of compliance status
<li>Mission Planning - a place to plan and make policy changes
<li>Mission Status - a place to see the current state of system repair
<li>Mission Library - a knowledge bank that connects information together
</ul>

   <p>Each of these categories is a beginning from which you can refine your overview and search
through information.

Mission status is a high level summary of how well the entire system
is behaving. From this page you can dive down into details about managed hosts,
by machine or by information type.

   <p>The row of bar meters shows the compliance of all registered hosts over the past
week, the past day and the past hour. It also summarizes performance
and anomalous behavior in a simple red, yellow green scale.

   <p>The hosts themselves are classified into red, yellow and green using a combination of
these considerations. Clicking on the colored links produces a list of the

<p>IT operations are referred to as <i>the mission</i> in the knowledge
base. The mission depends on key resources and can be viewed from a
number of perspectives, shown on the opening page.

   <p>The bar meter shows the site-summary status of a number of key
performance indicators. This is the highest level summary of mission
status.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><b>Week</b>: The average level of promise-compliance over the whole past week. 
<li><b>Day</b>:  The average level of promise-compliance over the past day. 
<li><b>Hour</b>:  The average level of promise-compliance over the past hour. 
<li><b>Perf</b>: The average performance status of the system, compared to the learned norm. 
<li><b>Soft</b>: Software update status of the system. 
<li><b>Lics</b>: Summary of licenses, i.e. number of active clients versus number of paid licenses promised. 
<li><b>Anom</b>: Level of anomalous site-wide activity on the system.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.4 Top 50 weakest hosts</h4>

<p>One the status page, there is a link to the top 50 worst machines.

Clicking further on each host takes you do detailed performance data as measured
by CFEngine's monitoring daemon.

   <p>We call this view pseudo-real time monitoring data, because there is
always some delay between when data were measured and when they become
available for you to view. Most tools simply hide this delay, but
CFEngine tells you precisely when data were last updated, providing crucial
information about system latencies.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.5 Pulse and vital signs</h4>

<p>For each host there is a `pulse and vital signs' link. This shows an
overview of monitoring data from each host and its current performance
statistics. In order to see data in these graphs, each host in the CFEngine
managed network must be running <code>cf-monitord</code> and <code>cf-serverd</code>. 
This is the default behavior for a Nova installation.

   <p>The main page of the pulse and vital signs shows up to 100 different measured
values, for which some activity has been seen<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

   <p>The graphs are arranged into three columns, representing three
different time-scales.  From the left:

     <ul>
<li>Past four hours. 
<li>Past weeks. 
<li>Statistical complete history. 
</ul>

   <p>The past four hours graph is updated regularly and shows the current
levels in 5 minute resolution. The weekly view shows data collected
over many weeks, overlaid onto a `periodogram', i.e. multiple weeks
averaged over a single week view. This reveals the strongest trends of
usage on the system.

   <p>The statistical history shows a spectral histogram, indicating the
distribution of all measured values about the mean. This shows how much
entropy or variation there is in the performance characteristic.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.7 The policy editor</h4>

<p>The CFEngine Nova Mission Portal provides an editor for working on
CFEngine language. It does not support user management
itself<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>, however there is a tie-in for Subversion version
control repositories.

   <p>Because there is no user management, each web-browser session will get
its own working environment. Thus, there will be limited persistence,
so remember to <em>commit your changes often</em>, especially before
closing the browser.

   <p>For security reasons, there is no automatic link between the policy
editor and the company policy in <code>masterfiles</code>. Subversion can be
used to handle access control, and a manual review and copy step is
required to deploy policy written in the editor.

   <p>The editor provides syntax high-lighting and look-up to make working
with CFEngine's extensive language easier.

   <p>The main key commands in the editor Window are:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Autocompletion: Ctrl+Space</i><dd>Shows a pop-up menu of possible items. This is context sensitive,
e.g. it also works inside lists (e.g. <code>bsdflags</code>) to provide
possible values. 
<br><dt><i>Undo: Ctrl+Z</i><dd> In Safari, Ctrl-backspace may be used. 
<br><dt><i>Redo: Ctrl+Y</i><dd>Undo an undo operation, i.e. reverse the direction of transaction roll. 
<br><dt><i>Indent: TAB</i><dd>Format a file to a standard indentation. 
</dl>
   Multiple documents appear as tabs along the top of the screen.

<div align="center"><img src="editor.png" alt="The front page"></div>
<div align="center">Figure: The Policy Editor</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

The CFEngine Nova policy editor detects syntax errors and highlights
these in red to avoid mistakes when editing.  In addition, by using
the <code>Check syntax</code> button, it is possible to pre-test the policy
before committing changes to a repository. This will run
<code>promises.cf</code> through the <code>cf-promises</code> parser.

   <p>The main menu on the left hand panel shows the main workflow items for
policy editing. Clicking the arrow in the panel divider collapses the
menu and gives full-screen editing.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.8 Integration with subversion</h4>

<p>The default architecture (page) proposes to work in close dialogue with a version
repository. CFEngine recommends the use of such a repository and currently
supports subversion.

   <p>Since the CFEngine Nova policy editor is a single user console,
authentication is required for each interaction with the
repository. Access control and authorization for policy are handled by
subversion's authentication system so that edits made in the Mission
Portal can be interleaved with edits from other sources.  The
subversion repository thus becomes the centerpiece of the distributed
coordination, as is the intended function of version control systems.

   <p>When working with a subversion repository, you first do a
&ldquo;checkout&rdquo;. This allows you to select the repository you want to
download and creates a working environment based on it. Note that the
editor currently only views files in the checked out repository, so if
you have a directory hierarchy, you need to check out multiple
times. After doing a checkout, you can view the path to the current
repository by clicking the link at the top.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="editor-svnpath.png" alt="Path to the current repository"></div>
<div align="center">Figure: Path to the current repository.</div>
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

   <p>The
&ldquo;update&rdquo; command downloads the newest files from the already checked
out subversion repository, while &ldquo;commit&rdquo; updates the repository
with your working copy. You also have the ability to see the
repository log of the 20 last changes. This includes changed files,
users and log messages. For more detailed information on working with
subversion, see <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">http://svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.

   <p>After editing you may or may not commit changes. When closing an
edited file, you are also given the option to commit at once.

</pre>
The menu choice to commit a current version commits all files in the
configuration repository. Commits require a mandatory comment. CFEngine recommends
you use this to explain why a change was made, or relate it to an incident number, etc. 
The details of <i>what</i> was changed are already documented by the version control
logs.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Reports in the Mission Portal</h3>

<p>A significant capability of CFEngine Nova over previous versions of
CFEngine is the existence of automated system reporting. CFEngine collects
history, state and change data about computers and ties them together. 
The CFEngine strategy is to replace conventional CMDBs with a more
scalable and flexible approach to information mining over the coming
years. Commercial versions of CFEngine are designed to bring state of
the art methods to the problem of information management for IT
operations.

   <p>A report is a tabular summary of CFEngine's internal information, tailored to
a particular purpose. Reports in CFEngine Nova are searchable, and describe
attributes and qualities of managed hosts.

   <p>In CFEngine Nova 2 reports are summarized and collected automatically by
the <code>cf-hub</code> program. This is a daemon which runs only on the system
hub or policy server. Its sole function is to connect to all registered
systems and build a searchable summary of its running state, in as efficient
a manner as possible.

   <p>In addition to the automated hub, reports may be generated on each individual
host using the <code>cf-report</code> program. This generates reports in a variety of
formats, either for direct viewing (in HTML) or for import/export to other
software systems, using XML or CSV output formats.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Should monitoring and configuration be separate?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
The traditional view of IT operations is that configuration,
monitoring and reporting a three different things that should not be
joined. Traditionally, all three have been independent centralized
processes. This view has emerged historically, but it has a major
problem.

   <p>Monitoring as an independent activity is inherently non-scalable. 
When numbers of hosts grow beyond a few thousands, centralized
monitoring schemes fail to manage the information. Tying configuration
(and therefore repair) to monitoring at the host level is essential
for the effective management of large and distributed data facilities. 
CFEngine foresaw this need in 1998, with its Computer Immunology
initiative, and continues to develop this strategy.

   <p>CFEngine's approach is to focus on scalability. The commercial editions
of CFEngine provide what meaningful information they can in a manner that
can be scaled to tens of thousands of machines.

<h3 class="section">3.4 What is a CMDB?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

A Configuration Management Database (CMDB), sometimes called a Change
and Configuration Management Database (CCMDB), is a repository of
information about hardware and its expected state. CMDBs are basically
an outgrowth of <i>inventory databases</i>. They were embraced by many IT
companies as a plausible solution to configuration management, in the
absence of an alternative.

   <p>A CMDB records so-called <i>configuration items</i> (CI), which record
technical, ownership and proposed state data. A CMDB does not
generally record actual state &ndash; this is left for monitoring software.

   <p>The term CMDB originates from the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
framework, where it is given a prominent role in system planning and
verification. The CMDB is by definition a centralized repository.

<h3 class="section">3.5 CMDB and CFEngine</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine deviates from the classical view of a CMDB to modernize the
concept for modern scaling requirements.  Configuration management
requires something more sophisticated than a database to describe
system patterns. The CMDB applies a <i>brute force</i> approach to
collection and searching of system data that does not scale well, and requires
large and expensive resources to manage.

   <p>CFEngine works with a highly compressed description of system
properties that is based on category classification rather than an
exhaustive inventory of computers. Being distributed in operation,
CFEngine can also enforce policy on state, without brute force imaging.

<h3 class="section">3.6 Decentralized data collection in CFEngine</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine is designed to scale to vast numbers of machines.  It does so
because it is fundamentally decentralized. Data about system state are
recorded <i>in situ</i> and are not transmitted over the network
directly. CFEngine summarizes and compresses system information before
making it available for central aggregation and analysis. This means
that high resolution data are available where they count, processing
is decentralized, and inexpensive summaries may be compared and mined
for correlations.

   <p>CFEngine's distributed architecture means that no data are lost if the
network fails temporarily. CFEngine uses the network <i>opportunistically</i>,
but it is not reliant on it for real-time operations.

If you have regular reporting needs, we recommend using our commercially supported
version of CFEngine (CFEngine Nova or above), as you will save considerable time
and resources in programming, and you will have access to the latest developments

</td></tr></table>

   <p>No promises made in CFEngine imply automatic aggregation of data to a central
location. In commercial CFEngine versions, e.g. CFEngine Nova, an optimized
aggregation of standardized reports is provided, but the ultimate decision to
aggregate must be yours.

   <p>Monitoring and reporting capabilities in CFEngine depend on the
software version include:

     <ul>
<li><b>Community Edition:</b> Basic output to file or logs may be customized on a per-promise basis. Users can design their own log and report formats, but data processing and extraction from CFEngine's embedded databases must be scripted by the user.

     <li><b>Nova:</b> In addition to community features, Nova provides automated extraction of
data from CFEngine's self-learning agents, and the generation of a
standard set of reports in text, HTML or XML formats. Nova summarizes
distributed data and provides simple compression and aggregation of
these summaries. Finally summaries are tied into a knowledge map or
semantic index for browsing by IT operations. At this level CFEngine exceeds
other industry CMDB solutions for configuration.

     <li><b>Constellation:</b> In addition to Nova features, Constellation performs
additional data extraction from the collected reports. It analyses correlations
and provides reverse look up of system attributes based on searchable expressions. 
At this level, CFEngine exceeds other industry CMDB solutions in both reporting
and configuration.

     <li><b>Galaxy:</b> In addition to Constellation features, Galaxy adds a number
of state of the art active probes that integrate network monitoring
with system node monitoring, offering a total and integrated overview
of networked system behavior.

   <p>If you enable the <code>report_diffs</code> feature in Nova, on
individually named files, a second `change tracking' report will be
aggregated, summarizing the major changes. On text-only files this
reports major changed in the spirit of the Unix <code>diff</code> command,
though comparatively simplified for a readability. Users can then use
other more specialized difference tools for alternative view for forensic
detail on the host concerned.

<h3 class="section">3.9 Knowledge Map</h3>

<p>The Knowledge Map is a tool that may be used as:
     <ul>
<li>An index of the information in the Knowledge Map
<li>A tool for brainstorming
<li>A tool for self-learning
</ul>

   <p>It is designed to show relationships between subjects of importance. 
The relationships are shown graphically and in text format.

   <p>The text relationships on the right hand side of the screen show direct relationships
between the current subject and neighboring subjects, but with semantic explanations. 
The graphical renditions attempt to show greater depth if possible. Due to the limited size of the
screen, and limitations of human cognition, only about twenty of the closest relationships are
depicted to create a sense of `where we are' in the landscape of knowledge. The actual
map might contain many thousands of entries.

   <p>There are up to two graphical representations on each page. The Copernicus view
is a depiction of the current topic in relation to its most important neighbors. 
The nodes in the graph are shown as `planetary balls'. The highest ranking (most connected)
topic is shown in yellow, and each node is sized according to its rank. 
The current topic has a black label, whereas all others have a white label.

<p>On each page you will find one or two graphics that illustrate the
current topic and its relationship to neighboring leads and
perspectives. This neighborhood shows you up to 30 of the closest
related topics, but it does not show you <i>how</i> they are
related. This picture is useful for seeing the `bigger picture', but
for a more detailed understanding you should look at the <i>Insight, leads and
Perspectives</i> panel. That panel tells you the exact nature of the relationship
to the closest topics in the map: in other words, what should you expect
to learn by following that link?

   <p>The graphical representation of the knowledge map shows the local
neighborhood you are currently exploring. Clicking on a panel to the right
will enlarge it. The current topic will be shown in yellow (with red text). 
You will only see a maximum of thirty topics at any one time.

   <p>The relative importance of the topics is shown by their size, and size is
determined by how many references a topic has to nearby topics. The most
important topic is placed as the star at the center of this `solar
system' view. Other nodes are colors pink, brown, grey depending on
their distance from it.

   <p>The current topic might not be the most important

<h4 class="subsection">3.10.1 Policy analysis</h4>

<p>CFEngine helps you to make sense of the knowledge implicit in your
current CFEngine policy, by turning it into an annotated map. You can
extend the automatically generated map with your own comments, topics
and documents, in order to tie in with your own enterprise
information. The knowledge map will normally run on a single machine,
such as the CFEngine policy server, but this is not a requirement.

   <p>The example figure below shows typical page generated by the knowledge
agent. It describes a CFEngine promise from the policy files. One such
page is generated for each policy promise, and pages may be generated
for reports from different computers. You can also create `topic
pages' for any local (enterprise) information that you have. In this
case the promise has been given the promise-handle
<code>update_policy</code>, and the associations and the lower graph shows
how this promise relates to other promises through its documented
dependencies (these are documented from the promisees and
<code>depends_on</code> attributes of other promises.).

   <p>The example page shows two figures, one above the other.  The upper
figure shows the thirty nearest topics (of any kind) that are related
to this one.  Here the relationships are unspecific. This diagram can
reveal pathways to related information that are often unexpected, and
illustrates relationships that broaden one's understanding of the
place the current promise occupies within the whole.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="dependency.png" alt="The visualization of dependencies in CFEngine with the knowledge agent's web rendering"></div>

   <p>The second figure shows a blow up of the dependency map
illustration. It is a subset of the larger picture, choosing only
those topics that are linked by impact-related associations.

   <p>Although these illustrations are just renderings of the `leads and perspectives' associations
shown in text, they are useful for visualizing several levels of depth
in the associative network. In particular, one can see the other
promises that could be affected if we were to make a change to the
current promise. 
Such impact analyses can be crucial to planning change and release management of policy. 
ITIL best practices recommend thorough pre-analyses of release changes. CFEngine Nova
combined with good practice of documentation makes this straightforward.

<h4 class="subsection">3.10.2 Understanding dependencies</h4>

<p>Nova adds automatically instrumentation to the policy compilation that allows
you to trace dependencies, provided you follow the best-practice when
constructing your promise rules.

   <p>When writing promises, get into the habit of giving every promise a comment
that explains its intention.

   <p>Also, give related promises <i>handles</i>, or labels that can be used to
refer to them by.

<pre class="verbatim">
files:

  "/var/cfengine/inputs"

    handle => "update_policy",

    perms => system("600"),
    copy_from => mycopy("$(master_location)","$(policy_server)"),
    depth_search => recurse("inf"),
    file_select => input_files,
    action => immediate;

</pre>
If a promise affects another promise in some way, you can make the affected
promise one of the promisees, like this:

<pre class="verbatim">
access:

  "/master/CFEngine/inputs" -> { "update_policy", "other_promisee" },

    handle  => "serve_updates",

    admit   => { "217.77.34.*" };

</pre>

   <p>Conversely, if a promise might depend on another in some (even indirect) way, document this too.

<pre class="verbatim">
files:

  "/var/cfengine/inputs"

    handle     => "update_policy",
    depends_on => "serve_updates",

    perms => system("600"),
    copy_from => my-copy("$(master_location)","$(policy_server)"),
    depth_search => recurse("inf"),
    file_select => input_files,
    action => immediate;


</pre>

   <p>The lower of the two diagrams on the knowledge page (called the influence channel) shows graphically
how dependency trails flow. The text links show the specific of each
relationship.

     <ul>
<li>When a bundle is passed a parameter by another
<li>In method calls, a passed variable value is considered a causal influence. 
<li>When a variable is used in a shell command
<li>When a variable is set by a function call that retrieves from a database/file

<h4 class="subsection">3.10.4 Why knowledge management?</h4>

<p>At CFEngine, we believe that Knowledge Management is the challenge of our times. 
As futurist Alvin Toffler wrote in his seminal 1970 study <i>Future Shock</i>
about the rapidity of industrial changes of the '60s:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<blockquote>
<i>"Rising novelty renders irrelevant the traditional goals of our chief
institutions...Acceleration produces a faster turnover of
goals. Diversity or fragmentation leads to a relentless multiplication... 
Caught in this churning, goal-cluttered environment, we
stagger...from crisis to crisis, pursuing a welter of
conflicting and self-cancelling purposes."</i>
</blockquote>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

We see it as a key strategy to provide simple tools that explain
<i>intentions</i> and <i>meaning</i> amongst the welter of system documentation and information.

<h3 class="section">3.11 cf-hub and data collection</h3>

<p>The `hub' is both a machine and a process in a default centralized
reporting architecture.  For most purposes, CFEngine avoids
centralization of effort in order to scale efficiently.  For
reporting, however, one needs a common location and standard of data
collection to provide accurate information, so we make an
exception. To make hub aggregation scale efficiently, Nova 2 uses an
extremely lightweight data encoding that is several hundred times
faster than the approach used in Nova 1. Using a hub, the process
can be parallelized and kept up to date more often than before.

<pre class="example">     host# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-hub
</pre>
   <p>The CFEngine hub runs in the background and connects to all known registered hosts and builds a
summary model of their state in a database. This database is
searchable and may be browsed using the Mission Portal.  Updates may
be collected manually also:

     host# cf-runagent -H hostname -q full

<h4 class="subsection">3.11.1 CMDB or SKMS</h4>

<p>Last generation systems have used the concept of the Configuration
Management Database (CMDB) as a central repository of information. The
CMDB concept was primitive and data-intensive; it had no concept of
intended versus un-intended state. Today the term SKMS or Service
Knowledge Management System is coming into use, based in ITIL version
3.  The idea here is to go beyond mere data-mining to a knowledge
oriented system.

   <p>CFEngine Nova provides a `next generation' knowledge-oriented overview
of IT operations in its Mission Portal. It combines intended state
maintained through policy, with actual state measured by observation,
and relates these for the user in a semantic web. This enables users
to relate measured data to actual strategic goals, and `connect the dots
between Business and IT'.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Business goals and the Service Catalogue</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Trust and confidence form just one of the pillars of business; agility
and creativity make up the others.  CFEngine Nova brings features that
make it possible to connect the dots meaningfully between high level
business goals and low level configuration implementation. 
This enables different layers of an organization to gain insight into how
the system is being managed, in relation to the strategic goals.

     <ul>
<li>CFEngine Nova's rich repertoire of configuration capabilities
allows model-based integration of systems, attending to the unique requirements
of each business service. Off-the-shelf does not have to mean bland and generic. 
Customization is CFEngine's forte. It is the glue holding applications together.

     <li>Nova's speed and use of patterns allows many small changes to be made
very quickly. 
</ul>
   Nova provides appropriate insight into IT operations
through explanation, reporting and visualization of policy, allowing
business and IT to gather around information of mutual interest. 
Of course, CFEngine is not going to make IT experts of business staff, or vice
versa.  However, business and IT work best together when then can
communicate effectively.  Our aim with Nova is to give business heads
just the right level of insight into technical IT operations to be assured that
their needs are being met<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Similarly,
Nova makes business goals available to IT staff so that they can feel
connected and responsible for the strategic goals of the organization.

   <p>The Service Catalogue is a concept that has been promoted as part of

are directed towards specific goals by adding a simple reference
The Nova Knowledge Map will then build a narrative around these references

<h3 class="section">4.2 Business value reports</h3>

<p>One of the capabilities of CFEngine is to add business or
organizational value to the configuration model. The notion of
business value is not a clear concept, but a very simple
approach to measuring value is to attach a monetary value
to the outcome of promises.

   <p>The <code>value_kept</code> (default value 1), <code>value_repaired</code>
(default value 0.5), <code>value_notkept</code> (default value -1) settings
fall under CFEngine transaction logging and allow administrators to
attach actual monetary (or other) values to promises kept, or issues
repaired, or conversely measure the loss of non-compliance in dollar
terms (choose your currency). This value is summed and recorded for
each execution of CFEngine, and can be turned into graphs for your
management reports.

   <p>An example of this report is shown below. The results are summed for each day and
presented in column form.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Monitoring extensions</h2>

<p>CFEngine Nova incorporates a lightweight monitoring agent, whose aim
is to provide meaningful performance data about systems, in a scalable
fashion.  CFEngine Nova does not aim to replace specialized
rapid-update monitoring and alarm systems; it provides a context-aware
summary of current state that is always displayed in relation to
previous system behavior, for comparison. The aim is to offer useful
analytics rather than jump-to alarms.

   <p>CFEngine's monitoring component <code>cf-monitord</code> records a number of
performance data about the system by default. These include process
counts, service traffic, load average and CPU utilization and
temperature when available.  In the Community Edition, data are
only collected and stored for personal use, but users have to work to see
results.  CFEngine Nova improves on this in three ways.

     <ul>
<li>Data collected from the monitoring system are integrated into
the aggregate knowledge console.

     <li>It adds a three year life-cycle trend summary, based any
`shift'-averages.

     <li>It add customizable promises to monitor or
log specific highly specific user data through the generic promise
interface.

   </ul>

   <p>The end result is to display time series traces of system performance, like the
above mentioned values, and customized logs feeding custom-defined
reports.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Integration of monitoring with knowledge base</h3>

<p>CFEngine Nova integrates monitoring reports with the automated base
knowledge to provided self-analysis and simple summary reporting. 
A `graphic equalizer' view shows important status summaries, and
the semantic links allow users to drill down to specific reporting data.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="mission.png" alt="Integrated Monitoring"></div>

   <p>Detailed time-series views can be collected and collated, providing
honest and accurate data that allow you to gauge your own confidence
level in system performance.  Unlike most monitoring solutions,
CFEngine shows you its own confidence in the measurements taken. It
takes a finite amount of time to measure and transport data from
systems to the knowledge console. That time also provides information
about system performance. CFEngine always promises to tell you how old
data are and how confident it is in the values.

</div>

<h3 class="section">5.2 Long term trends</h3>

<p>CFEngine normally operates with time-series data represented
in two forms:

     <ul>
<li>A weekly average, plotted on a periodogram, showing performance now in relation
to the same time of week in previous weeks. After about a month data are forgotten
to ensure a sufficient rate of adaptation to new patterns. 
<li>The past four hours in high resolution. 
</ul>

   <p>CFEngine Nova adds quarter day averages of recorded time-series which go back three
years in time. Three years is considered to be the lifetime of a computer. 
Summaries of the detailed performance are summarized by flat averages for
a four-shift day:
     <ul>
<li><b>Night shift</b>: from midnight 00:00 to 06:00
<li><b>Morning shift</b>: from 06:00 to 12:00
<li><b>Afternoon shift</b>: from 12:00 to 18:00
<li><b>Evening shift</b>: from 18:00 to 00:00
</ul>

<h3 class="section">5.3 Custom promises to measure</h3>

<p>CFEngine Nova adds a new promise type in bundles for the monitoring
agent. These are written just like all other promises within a bundle
destined for the agent concerned. In this case:

<pre class="verbatim">bundle monitor watch

{
measurements:

  # promises ...

}

</pre>

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Extraction-strings-and-logging">Extraction strings and logging</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Extraction strings and logging</h4>

<p>Let's take a generic example. Suppose we have a file of nonsense  <samp><span class="file">/tmp/testmeasure</span></samp>
and we want to extract some information that we call a `blonk'
from the file. A blonk is always on the second line of this file following
a prefix `Blonk blonk '. We would get the value like this:

<pre class="verbatim">
  "/tmp/testmeasure"

      handle => "blonk_watch",
      stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "string",
      history_type => "log",
      units => "blonks",
      match_value => find_blonks,
      action => sample_min("10");

</pre>

   <p>This promise body has several attributes.

     <dl>
<dt><code>handle</code><dd>It is essential to give measurement promises handles, as these are used to label the
log files that will store the values.

     <br><dt><code>stream_type</code><dd>Tells us that we are reading from what the system considered to be a regular file
on the file-system.

     <br><dt><code>data_type</code><dd>This says that data are to be treated as text with no other meaning.

     <br><dt><code>history_type</code><dd>This tells us that we want to log the values with a time stamp.

     <br><dt><code>units</code><dd>This string is used in documentation to explain the measurement units of this result.

     <br><dt><code>match_value</code><dd>This is a body reference that represents the algorithm by which we extract data from the file.

     <br><dt><code>action</code><dd>This is the generic action parameter that may be added to all promises. We use it
here to limit the sample rate of this promise; <code>cf-monitord</code> samples by default
at a rate of once per 2.5 minutes. 
</dl>

   <p>The matching body uses a method for selecting the correct line, and a way
for extracting a pattern from the line. In every case the value extracted
is described  by using a regular expression <i>back-reference</i>, i.e. 
a parenthesized expression  within a regular expression. The expression should
match the entire line and should contain exactly one parenthesis.

<pre class="verbatim">body match_value find_blonks
{
select_line_number => "2";
extraction_regex => "Blonk blonk ([blonk]+).*";
}
</pre>

   <p>The sampling rate is controlled by using the generic <code>action</code> constraint.
<pre class="verbatim">body action sample_min(x)
{
ifelapsed => "$(x)";
expireafter => "$(x)";
}
</pre>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.2 Extracting one-off numerical data</h4>

<p>In this example we extract an integer value from an existing file. 
Notice that CFEngine samples the process table during <code>processes</code>
promises so you might be able to save a new execution of a
shell command and use the cached data, depending on your need
for immediacy. It is always good practice to limit the system
load incurred by monitoring.

<pre class="verbatim">  # Test 2 - follow a special process over time
  # using CFEngine's process cache to avoid resampling

   "/var/cfengine/state/cf_rootprocs"

      handle => "monitor_self_watch",
      stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "int",
      history_type => "static",
      units => "kB",
      match_value => proc_value(".*cf-monitord.*",

         "root\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+([0-9]+).*");

</pre>

   <p>This match body selects a line matching a particular regular expression
and extracts the 6th column of the process table. The regular expression
skips first the root string and then five numerical values. 
The value is extracted into a one-off value

<pre class="verbatim">body match_value proc_value(x,y)
{
select_line_matching => "$(x)";
extraction_regex => "$(y)";
}
</pre>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.3 Extraction to list variable</h4>

<p>In this example we discover a list of disks attached to the system.
<pre class="verbatim">  # Test 3, discover disk device information

  "/bin/df"

      stream_type => "pipe",
      data_type => "slist",
      history_type => "static",
      units => "device",
      match_value => file_system,
      action => sample_min("480"); # this is not changing much!

</pre>

<h3 class="section">5.4 Uses for custom monitoring</h3>

<p>Unlike most other monitoring tools that use heavy-weight scripting
languages to exact data, often running many processes for each
measurement, CFEngine is a lightweight probe, using file interfaces
and regular expressions to extract data. Thus its impact on the
system is minimal. The possibilities for using this are therefore
extremely broad:

     <ul>
<li>Extracting accounting data from systems for charge-back. 
This could be useful in cloud scenarios. 
<li>Discovering memory leaks. 
<li>Looking for zombie processes relating to specific software. 
<li>Logging up-time. 
<li>System class-dependent discovery and extraction of any kind of text
for insertion into a CMDB. 
</ul>

<h2 class="chapter">6 Database Promises</h2>

<p>CFEngine Nova can interact with commonly used database servers to keep
promises about the structure and content of data within them.

   <p>CFEngine is, of course, not the tool of choice for performing complex
database transactions, but it is an appropriate choice of tool for
managing policy about the existence and structure of databases and
correcting discrepancies.

<h3 class="section">6.1 How to manage databases</h3>

<p>There are two main cases of database management to address: small
embedded databases and large centralized databases.

   <p>CFEngine is a tool whose strength lies distributed management of
computers.  Databases are often centralized entities that have
single point of management, so a large monolithic database
is more easily managed with other tools. However, CFEngine can still
monitor changes and discrepancies, and it can manage smaller embedded
databases that are distributed in nature, whether they are SQL,
registry or future types.

   <p>So creating 100 new databases for test purposes is a task for
CFEngine, but adding a new item to an important production database is
not a task that we recommend using CFEngine for.

   <p>There are three kinds of database supported by Nova:

     <dl>
<dt><em>LDAP - The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</em><dd>A hierarchical network database primarily for reading simple schema.

     <br><dt><em>SQL - Structured Query Language</em><dd>A number of relational databases (currently supported: MySQL, Postgres)
for reading and writing complex data.

     <br><dt><em>Registry - Microsoft Registry</em><dd>An embedded database for interfacing with system values in Microsoft Windows.

   </dl>
   In addition, CFEngine uses a  variety of embedded databases
for its own internals.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Database-Promises">Database Promises</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.2 Database access rights</h3>

<p>CFEngine's ability to make promises about databases depends on the
good grace of the database server. Embedded databases are directly
part of the system and promises can be made directly. However,
databases running through a server process (either on the same host or
on a different host) are independent agents and CFEngine cannot make
promises on their behalf, unless they promise (grant) permission for
CFEngine to make the changes. Thus the pre-requisite for making
SQL database promises is to grant a point of access on the server.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Database-Promises">Database Promises</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.3 Creating a point of contact on a server</h3>

<p>The default behavior is for databases to deny connection access
to external parties. However, it is possible to create a connection database
that can be used as an anchor point. Once CFEngine is connected to any database,
it can create new ones.

</div>

<h3 class="section">6.4 Creating SQL databases</h3>

<p>Although the Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard, database servers
diverge wildly in their approaches to interaction. CFEngine currently supports
two open source database implementations: MySQL and PostgreSQL and these two
could not be more different.

   <p>Although it would be desirable to perform operations like create and
destroy databases from within CFEngine, these operations can be
difficult to set up due to security design of the database
servers. This is where CFEngine's idea of <i>voluntary cooperation</i>
helps us to understand why. The database service (even running on
localhost) is an independent entity that we must interact with through
its service portal. It promises nothing a priori, so we must arrange
for the necessary promises to be kept so that the database will
respond to CFEngine's manipulations. In other words, we have to grant
access.

<p>To refer to tables in an SQL database, you treat the tables as if they
were sub-directories of the database. In this example, we create one of
the topic map tables for the knowledge base.

   <p>Table existence is determined by the <code>database_operation</code> attribute. 
We specify columns in a table as doublets or triplets with SQL type-names. 
In this example CFEngine will assume the promise below to be a complete
specification of the table. Thus

     <ul>
<li>It will create non-existing columns (in no guaranteed order). 
<li>It will report about columns that exist but are not promised,
i.e. indicating that the table has been edited inappropriately.

<h3 class="section">6.6 MS Registry functions</h3>

<p>Another important database for Windows systems is the MS registry. 
The registry looks like a file-system, with files inside directories. 
in MS nomenclature, the registry consists of <i>(value,data)</i> pairs inside
"keys" which are like directories. Keys may contain sub-keys in a hierarchical
manner.

   <p>Managing data in the registry is a key part of Windows administration.

     <ul>
<li>Important system settings are located in and hence controlled by the registry. 
<li>Security and compliance guidelines often specify values for the registry. 
<li>If registry data become corrupted, software can cease to function. 
Compliance with government standards such as the U.S. FDCC regulations involves
registry compliance checking. 
<li>Automated repair (self-healing) of Windows machines can involve registry repair. 
</ul>

   <p>CFEngine Nova has functions for
     <ul>
<li>Creating and deleting keys, and <i>(value,data)</i> pairs. 
<li>Scanning values and performing change detection. 
<li>Restore or repair damaged registry data its cache in real-time. 
</ul>

<p>Value-data pairs are in-fact value-type-data triplets, though the most common

<h4 class="subsection">6.6.3 Deleting registry keys</h4>

<p>The <code>drop</code> or <code>delete</code> option is used to delete keys from a database. 
CFEngine does not (presently) perform recursive deletions of keys. It is debatable whether
this feature would be potentially too destructive an operation to make simple.

   <p>In order to be allowed to delete a key or database, you must define a comment. This
acts as a confirmation of intent to avoid accidents.

  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CFEngine AS\CFEngine"

    database_operation => "delete",
    database_type => "ms_registry";

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#MS-Registry-functions">MS Registry functions</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">6.6.4 Deleting registry values</h4>

<p>If a registry deletion contains <code>columns</code>, these can be selected for deletion. 
It is not possible to delete rows in the registry (which corresponds to
the just the data in a value-data pair.

<pre class="verbatim">
  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CFEngine AS\CFEngine"

    database_operation => "delete",
    database_columns => { "value1", "value2" } ,
    database_type => "ms_registry";

</pre>

   <p>Note that, unlike the case of adding values, there should be no comma separated
doublets in this list of values, as one cannot delete by data, only by value.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">6.6.5 Scanning and restoring the registry</h4>

<p>CFEngine has the ability to scan a portion of the registry and cache its
values for change detection and even later restoration. Since this is
a resource consuming operation it should be performed only rarely, i.e. 
one should limit the policy to scan to special occasions.

   <p>The key question to ask is: when do I expect the current state of the registry
to be a proper and true reflection of the `correct state' of the system. 
This is not a trivial question to answer and it should be given careful thought
before any talk of restoring the state of the registry based on such a scan.

   <p>Some values in the registry change often and one would like to ignore them
entirely. The <code>registry_exclude</code> list allows you to make a list
of regular expressions to match keys and value-names which are neither scanned
nor restored.

<pre class="verbatim">
bundle agent registry

{
databases:

 windows:: # add a time qualifier to this class

 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CFEngine AS\CFEngine"

    database_operation => "cache",   # cache,restore

    registry_exclude => {
                        ".*Windows.*CurrentVersion.*",
                        ".*Touchpad.*",
                        ".*Capabilities.FileAssociations.*",
                        ".*Rfc1766.*" ,
                        ".*Synaptics.SynTP.*",
                        ".*SupportedDevices.*8086",
                        ".*Microsoft.*ErrorThresholds"
                        },

    database_type     => "ms_registry";

</pre>

   <p>Once one believes and trusts in a scan of the registry as a matter of policy,
the values can be compared to this golden standard and restored if in error
with the following kind of promise:

<pre class="verbatim">
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\CFEngine AS"

   database_operation => "restore",
   database_type      => "ms_registry";

</pre>

   <p>Deletion or alteration of a key or value will now be swiftly repaired
without the need to reboot the system.

<p>Relying on LDAP or other network data without validation is a
potentially dangerous policy. One could destroy a system by assuming
that the service will respond with a sensible result. CFEngine does
not recommend reliance on any network services in a configuration policy.

   <p>The failure to find an item in LDAP does not imply its non-existence. 
Policies should work opportunistically. If something is found, it may be
used. If something is not found, it is difficult to conclude the reason
for this.

   <p>If users are removed from a system, a best practice would be to add
their names to a list of users who should not exist, rather than
assuming that the failure of a search for the user implies his/her
absence from the system.

<h3 class="section">7.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>Access Control Lists (ACL) allow for a more fine-grained access control on
file system objects than standard Unix permissions. In spite of the success
of the POSIX model's simplicity the functionality is limited.

   <p>File permission security is a subtle topic. Users should take care
when experimenting with ACLs as the results can often be
counter-intuitive. In some cases the functioning of a system can be
compromised by changes of access rights.

   <p>Not all file systems support ACLs. In Unix systems there is a plethora
of different file system types, which have different models of ACLs. 
Be aware that the mount-options for a file-system may affect the ACL
semantics.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>Note that when adding a user to a group, this will not have any
effect until the next time the user logs in on many operating
systems.</i>
</td></tr></table>

   <p>As CFEngine works across multiple platforms and needs to support ACLs
with different APIs, a common ACL syntax has been abstracted to add a
layer of portability. This is a specific feature of CFEngine, not of
the host systems. A generic syntax ensures that the ACLs that are
commonly needed can be coded in a portable fashion. CFEngine Nova's
ACL model is translated into native permissions for implementation;
CFEngine does not interfere with native access mechanisms in any way. 
The CFEngine ACL syntax is similar to the POSIX ACL syntax, which is
supported by BSD, Linux, HP-UX and Solaris.

   <p>CFEngine also allows you to specify platform-dependent ACLs. Of
course, these ACLs will only work on the given platform, and must
therefore be shielded with classes that select the appropriate model
within the promise body.

   <p>Currently, CFEngine Nova supports the following ACL APIs and operating
systems.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Concepts</h4>

<p>As mentioned, there are many different ACL APIs. For example, the
POSIX draft standard, NTFS and NFSv4 have different and incompatible
ACL APIs. As CFEngine is cross-platform, these differences should, for
the most usual cases, be transparent to the user. However, some
distinctions are impossible to make transparent, and thus the user
needs to know about them.

   <p>We will explore the different concepts of ACL implementations that are
critical to understanding how permissions are defined and enforced in
the different file systems. As a running example, we will consider
NTFS ACLs and POSIX ACLs, because the distinction between these ACL
APIs is strong.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.2 Entity types</h4>

<p>All ACL APIs support three basic entity types: user, group and
all. User and group are simply users and groups of the system, where a
group may contain multiple users. all is all users of the system, this
type is called "other" in POSIX and "Everyone" in NTFS.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.3 Owners</h4>

<p>All file system objects have an owner, which by default is the entity
that created the object. The owner can always be a user. However, in
some file systems, groups can also be owners (e.g. the
"Administrators" group in NTFS). In some ACL APIs (e.g POSIX),
permissions can be set explicitly for the owner, i.e. the owner has an
independent ACL entry.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#File-ACL-example">File ACL example</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.4 Changing owner</h4>

<p>It is generally not possible for user A to set user B as the
owner of a file system object, even if A owns the object. The
superuser ("root" in POSIX, "Administrator" in NTFS) can however
always set itself as the owner of an object. In POSIX, the superuser
may in fact set any user as the owner, but it NTFS it can only take
ownership.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#File-ACL-example">File ACL example</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.5 Permissions</h4>

<p>An entity can be given a set of permissions on a file system object
(e.g. read and write). The data structure holding the permissions for
one entity is called an "Access Control Entry" (ACE). As many users
and groups may have sets of permissions on a given object, multiple
Access Control Entries are combined to an Access Control List, which
is associated with the object.

   <p>The set of available permissions differ with ACL APIs. For example,
the "Take Ownership" permission in NTFS has no equivalent in
POSIX. However, for the most common situations, it is possible to get
equivalent security properties by mapping a set of permissions in one
API to another set in a second API.

   <p>There are however different rules for the access to the contents of a
directory with no access. In POSIX, no sub-objects of a directory with
no access can be accessed. However, in NTFS, sub-objects that the entity
has access rights to can be accessed, regardless of whether the entity
has access rights to the containing directory.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#File-ACL-example">File ACL example</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.6 Deny permissions</h4>

<p>If no permissions are given to a particular entity, the entity will be
denied any access to the object. But in some file systems, like NTFS,
it is also possible to explicitly deny specific permissions to
entities. Thus, two types of permissions exist in these systems: allow
and deny.

   <p>It is generally good practice to design the ACLs to specify who is
allowed to do some operations, in contrary to who is not allowed to do
some operations, if possible. The reason for this is that describing
who is not allowed to do things tend to lead to more complex
rules and could therefore more easily lead to mis-configurations and
security holes. A good rule is to only define that users should not be
able to access a resource in the following two scenarios:

     <ul>
<li>Denying access to a subset of a group which is allowed access
<li>Denying a specific permission when a user or a group has full access
</ul>

   <p>If you think about it, this is the same principle that applies to
firewall configuration: it is easier to white-list, specify who should
have access, than to blacklist, specify who should not have access. In
addition, since CFEngine is designed to be cross-platform and some ACL
permissions are not available on all platforms, we should strive to
keep the ACLs as simple as possible. This helps us avoid surprises
when the ACLs are enforced by different platforms.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.7 Changing permissions</h4>

<p>Generally, only the owner may change permissions on a file system
object. However, superusers can also indirectly change permissions by
taking ownership first. In POSIX, superusers can change permissions
without taking ownership. In NTFS, either ownership or a special
permission ("Change Permissions") is needed to alter permissions.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.8 Effective permissions</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, even though two ACL APIs support all the permissions
listed in an ACL, the ACL may be interpreted differently. For a given
entity and object with ACL, there are two conceptually different ways
to interpret which permissions the entity obtains: ACE precedence and
cumulative ACL.

<!-- TODO: create figure of example? -->
   <p>For example, let &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; be a user of the group
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">staff</span></samp>&rsquo;. There is an ACL on the file <samp><span class="file">schedule</span></samp>, giving
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; write permission, and the group &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">staff</span></samp>&rsquo; read
permission. We will consider two ways to determine the effective
permissions of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; to <samp><span class="file">schedule</span></samp>.

   <p>Firstly, by taking the most precise match in the ACL, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; will be
granted write permission only. This is because an ACE describing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo;
is more precise than an ACE describing a group &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; is member
of. However, note that some ACEs may have the same precedence, like
two ACEs describing permissions for groups &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; is member of. Then,
cumulative matching will be done on these ACEs (explained next). This
is how POSIX does it.

   <p>Secondly, we can take the cumulative permissions, which yields a user
permissions from all the ACE entries with his user name, groups he is
member of or the ACE entry specifying all users. In this case,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; would get read and write on <samp><span class="file">schedule</span></samp>. NTFS
computes the effective permissions in this way.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.9 Inheritance</h4>

<!-- TODO: Correct to inherit to someone ? -->
<p>Directories have ACLs associated with them, but they also have the
ability to inherit an ACL to sub-objects created within them. POSIX
calls the former ACL type "access ACL" and the latter "default ACL",
and we will use the same terminology.

<!-- TODO: Create tool to output effective permissions if ACL is applied ? -->
<h3 class="section">7.3 CFEngine 3 Generic ACL Syntax</h3>

<!-- FIXME: TODO: Say which OS's we are supporting, and which ACL types -->
<!-- we are supporting on them. -->
<p>The CFEngine 3 ACL syntax is divided into two main parts, a generic
and an API specific (native). The generic syntax can be used on any
file system for which CFEngine supports ACLs, while the native syntax
gives access to all the permissions available under a particular ACL
API.

   <p>An ACL can contain both generic and native syntax. However, if it
contains native syntax, it can only be enforced on systems supporting
the given ACL API. Thus, only the generic syntax is portable.

   <p>Note that even though the same generic ACL is set on two systems with
different ACL APIs, it may be enforced differently because the ACE
matching algorithms differ. For instance, as discussed earlier, NTFS
uses cumulative matching, while POSIX uses precedence
matching. CFEngine cannot alter the matching algorithms, and
simulating one or the other by changing ACL definitions is not
possible in all cases, and would probably lead to confusion. Thus, if
an ACL is to be used on two systems with different ACL APIs, the user
is encouraged to check that any differences in matching algorithms do
not lead to mis-configurations.

   <p>The CFEngine generic ACL syntax explained next, and native syntax is
described in following sections.

     <ul>
<li><code>acl_alias</code> is the name of the specified ACL. It can be any
  identifier containing alphanumeric characters and underscores. We
will use this name when referring to the ACL.

     <li><code>acl_type</code> (optional) specifies the ACL API used to
describe the ACL. It defaults to <code>generic</code>, which allows only
CFEngine generic ACL syntax, but is valid on all supported
systems. <code>acl_type</code> only needs to be specified if native
permissions are being used in the ACL (see <code>nperms</code> below). If
<code>acl_type</code> is set to anything other than <code>generic</code>, the
system on which it is enforced must support this ACL API.

     <li><code>acl_method</code> (optional) can be set to either
  <code>append</code> or <code>overwrite</code>, and defaults to
  <code>append</code>. Setting it to <code>append</code> only adds or modifies the
  ACEs that are specified in <code>aces</code> (and
  <code>specify_inherit_aces</code>, see below). If set to
  <code>overwrite</code>, the specified ACL will completely replace the
  currently set ACL. All required fields must then be set in the
  specified ACL (e.g. <code>all</code> in POSIX), see the following sections
  describing the supported native APIs.

     <!-- TODO: Support acl_method:append for specify_inherit_aces independently? -->
     <li><code>acl_directory_inherit</code> (optional) specifies the ACL of
  newly created sub-objects. Only valid if the ACL is set on a
directory. On directories, <code>nochange</code> is the default and
indicates that the ACL that is currently given to newly created child
objects is left unchanged. If set to <code>clear</code>, no ACL will be
inherited, but the file system specifies a default ACL, which varies
with the file system (see the following sections on the supported ACL
APIs). <code>parent</code> indicates that the ACL set in <code>aces</code> (see
below) should be inherited to sub-objects.  If set to <code>specify</code>,
<code>specify_inherit_aces</code> specifies the inherited ACL, and
<code>acl_method</code> applies for <code>specify_inherit_aces</code> too.

     <li><code>aces</code> is a list of access control entries. It is parsed
  from left to right, and multiple entries with the same entity-type
  and id is allowed. This is necessary to specify permissions with
  different <code>perm_type</code> for the same entity (e.g. to allow read
  permission but explicitly deny write).

     <li><code>specify_inherit_aces</code> (optional) is a list of access control
  entries that are set on child objects. It is also parsed from left
  to right and allows multiple entries with same entity-type and
  id. Only valid if <code>acl_directory_inherit</code> is set to
  <code>specify</code>.

     <li><code>user</code> indicates that the line applies to a user specified
  by the user identifier <code>uid</code>. <code>mode</code> is the permission
  mode string.

     <li><code>group</code> indicates that the line applies to a group specified
  by the group identifier <code>gid</code>. <code>mode</code> is the permission
  mode string.

     <li><code>all</code> indicates that the line applies to every
  user. <code>mode</code> is the permission mode string.

     <li><code>uid</code> is a valid user name for the system and
  cannot be empty. However, if <code>acl_type</code> is <code>posix</code>,
<code>uid</code> can be set to * to indicate the user that owns the file
system object.

     <li><code>gid</code> is a valid group name for the system and
  cannot be empty. However, if <code>acl_type</code> is <code>posix</code>,
<code>gid</code> can be set to * to indicate the file group.

     <li><code>mode</code> is one or more strings
  <code>op</code>|<code>gperms</code>|(<code>nperms</code>); a concatenation of <code>op</code>,
  <code>gperms</code> and optionally (<code>nperms</code>), see below, separated
  with commas (e.g. +rx,-w(s)). <code>mode</code> is parsed from left to
  right. 
<!-- TODO: include support for @code{fullaccess}, @code{noaccess}, -->
<!-- and @code{remove} -->

     <li><code>op</code> specifies the operation on any existing permissions,
  if the specified ACE already exists. <code>op</code> can be =, empty, + or
  -. = or empty sets the permissions to the ACE as stated, + adds and
  - removes the permissions from any existing ACE.

     <li><code>nperms</code> (optional) specifies ACL API specific
  (native) permissions. Only valid if <code>acl_type</code> is not
  <code>generic</code>. Valid values for <code>nperms</code> varies with different
  ACL types, and are specified in subsequent sections.

     <li><code>perm_type</code> (optional) can be set to either <code>allow</code> or
  <code>deny</code>, and defaults to <code>allow</code>. <code>deny</code> is only valid
  if <code>acl_type</code> is set to an ACL type that support deny
  permissions.

<h3 class="section">7.4 POSIX ACL type</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.1 POSIX-specific ACL syntax</h4>

<p><b>Native permissions</b>
The valid values for <code>nperms</code> in POSIX are <code>r</code>,<code>w</code>, and
<code>x</code>. These are in fact the same as the generic permissions, so
specifying them as generic or native gives the same effect.

   <p><b>File owner and group</b>
A user-ACE with uid set to * indicates file object owner. A group-ACE
with gid set to * indicates file group.

   <p><b>mask</b> mask can be specified as a normal ACE, as
<code>mask:mode</code>. mask specifies the maximum permissions that are
granted to named users (not owning user), file group and named
groups. mask is optional, if it is left unspecified it will will be
computed as the union of the permissions granted to named users, file
group and named groups (see acl_calc_mask(3)).

   <p><b>Required ACEs</b> POSIX requires existence of an ACE for the file
owner, (<code>user:*:mode</code>), the file group (<code>group:*:mode</code>),
other (<code>all:mode</code>) and mask (<code>mask:mode</code>). As mentioned,
CFEngine automatically creates a mask-ACE, if missing. However, if
<code>method</code> is set to <code>overwrite</code>, the user must ensure that
the rest of the required entries are specified.

<h4 class="subsection">7.4.2 Generic syntax mapping</h4>

<p><b>Entity types</b>
All entity types in the generic syntax are mapped to the corresponding
entity types with the same name in POSIX, except <code>all</code> which
corresponds to <code>other</code> in POSIX.

   <p><b>Generic permissions</b>

   <p>As shown in the table below, <code>gperms</code> is mapped straightforward
from generic to POSIX permission flags.

   <p><b>Inheritance</b> POSIX supports <code>acl_directory_inherit</code> set to
<code>specify</code>. The <code>specify_inherit_aces</code> list is then set as the
default ACL in POSIX (see acl(5)).

   <p>If <code>acl_directory_inherit</code> is set to <code>parent</code>, CFEngine
copies the access ACL to the default ACL. Thus, newly created objects
get the same access ACL as the containing directory.

   <p><code>acl_directory_inherit</code> set to <code>clear</code> corresponds to no
POSIX default ACL. This results in that newly created objects get ACEs
for owning user, group and other. The permissions are set in
accordance with the mode parameter to the creating function and the
umask (usually results in 644 for files and 755 for directories).

   <p><b>Further reading</b> The manual page <code>acl(5)</code> contains much
information on POSIX ACLs, including the access check algorithm. In
particular, this shows that POSIX uses ACE precedence matching, and
exactly how it is done. Operating systems usually bundle tools for
manipulating ACLs, for example <code>getfacl(1)</code> and
<code>setfacl(1)</code>.

<p><b>Native permissions</b>
NTFS supports fourteen so-called special file permissions. However, we
do not consider the <code>Synchronize</code> permission because it is used
for a different purpose than the other permissions. In order to give
access to the thirteen relevant permissions, CFEngine defines a native
permission flag for each of them. This one-to-one mapping is as
follows.

   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>The semantics of these special permissions can be found in the
references for further reading below.

   <p><b>Denying permissions</b>
NTFS supports setting <code>perm_type</code> to <code>deny</code> in addition to
<code>allow</code>, which is the default. This can for instance be used to
denying a user a particular permission that a group membership grants
him. It is important to note that the precedence of allow and deny
permissions is as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Explicit Deny
<li>Explicit Allow
<li>Inherited Deny from parent
<li>Inherited Allow from parent
<li>Inherited Deny from grandparent
<li>Inherited Allow from grandparent
<li>...
        </ol>

   <p>Thus, the closer the permission is to the object in the directory
path, the greater precedence it is given.

   <p>An important point here is that even though a user is denied access in
a parent directory and this permission is inherited, but one of the
groups he is member of is explicitly allowed access to a file in that
directory, he is actually allowed to access the file.

   <p><b>Ownership</b>
In NTFS, the default owner is the user who is currently logged on. The
only exceptions occur when the user is a member of either the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Administrators</span></samp>&rsquo; group or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Domain Admins</span></samp>&rsquo; group.

   <p>Owners of NTFS objects can allow another user to take ownership by
giving that user Take Ownership permission. Owners can also give other
users the Change Permissions flag. In addition, members of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Administrator</span></samp>&rsquo; group can always take ownership. It is never
possible to give ownership of an object to a user, but members of
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Administrator</span></samp>&rsquo; group can give ownership to that group.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.2 Generic syntax mapping</h4>

<p><b>Entity types</b>
The three entity types of NTFS are called user, group and
Everyone. The user and group entity types in NTFS are mapped to the
user and group entity types in CFEngine. Everyone is mapped to all in
CFEngine.

   <p><b>Generic permissions</b>
For NTFS, CFEngine maps the <code>gperms</code> to <code>nperms</code> as
follows.

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="30%">Generic flag  </th><th valign="top" width="30%">Native flags
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>r</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>rtTp</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>w</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>wabB</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>x</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>x</code>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>The rationale for this mapping is discussed next.

   <p>NTFS groups the thirteen special permissions to create five sets of
permissions:
     <ul>
<li>Read
<li>Read &amp; Execute
<li>Write
<li>Modify
<li>Full Control
</ul>
   In addition, we have the List Folder Contents set, which is equivalent
to the Read &amp; Execute set but is only available to- and inherited by
directories. The Full Control set is unsurprisingly all the thirteen
special permissions. An overview of the NTFS mapping of special
permissions to sets is given in the references stated as further
reading below. The NTFS permission sets can be expressed in CFEngine
syntax as follows.

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="30%">NTFS sets  </th><th valign="top" width="40%">CFEngine gperms|(nperms)
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Read</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>r</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Write</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>w</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Read &amp; Execute</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>rx</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Modify</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>rwx(d)</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Full Control</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>rwx(dDco)</code>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p><b>Inheritance</b>
<code>acl_directory_inherit</code> set to <code>clear</code> disables
inheritance, such that child objects get a default ACL specified by
the operating system, namely Full control for the file object creator and
<code>SYSTEM</code> accounts.

   <p><b>POSIX compatibility</b>
Be aware that setting <code>gperms</code> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; on directories is
more restrictive in NTFS than in POSIX ACLs. This is because NTFS does
not allow deletion of objects within a directory without a Delete
Sub-folders and Files permission on the directory (or a Delete
permission on the object itself), while in POSIX, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
directory is sufficient to delete any file or directory within it
(except when the sticky-flag is set on the directory). Thus, on
directories, the NTFS-equivalent to POSIX <code>gperms</code> set to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx(D)</span></samp>&rsquo;. However, for files, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; is
equivalent in POSIX and NTFS semantics.

   <p>In POSIX ACLs, there is no explicit delete permission, but the
execute, write and sticky permissions on the containing directory
determines if a user has privileges to delete. In POSIX, the owner and
root can change permissions, while usually only the root may change
the ownership, so there is no direct equivalent to the Change
Permission and Take Ownership in POSIX.

into sets is given at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419</a>.

server, namely the ability to encode data directly in policy. 
This feature is useful for distributing password hashes

<h3 class="section">8.1 Server access resource type</h3>

<p>By default, access to resources granted by the server are
files. However, sometimes it is useful to cache <code>literal</code>
strings, hints and data in the server, e.g. the contents of variables,
hashed passwords etc for easy access. In the case of literal data, the
promise handle serves as the reference identifier for queries. Queries
are instigated by function calls by any agent.

<pre class="verbatim">access:

  "This is a string with a $(localvar) for remote collection"

        handle  => "test_scalar",
  resource_type => "literal",
        admit   => { "127.0.0.1" };

</pre>

   <p>The promise looks exactly like a promise for a file object, but the data
are literal and entered into the policy. This is a useful approach for
distributing password hashes on a need-to-know basis from a central location. 
The server configuration file need not be distributed to any client, thus
only authorized systems will have access to the hashes.

<h3 class="section">9.1 Environments in Nova</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Nova supports notion of `environments' &ndash; named groups of hosts, like
`development', 'QA' and 'production' hosts.

   <p>Each environment gets
     <ul>
<li>Separate subdirectory `environment_&lt;NAME&gt;' for storing promises
<li>Separate subdirectory `environment_&lt;NAME&gt;/cdp_inputs' for content-based policies
<li>grouping of hosts belonging to environment in GUI
</ul>

   <p>Default Nova policies group hosts into environments in bundle `common
environments'. This bundle defines
     <ul>
<li>`environments.active' variable. This variable holds the name of environment for current host, and is used by other promises in Nova templates. This variable does not affect grouping in GUI. 
<li>global `environment_&lt;NAME&gt;' class. This class should be defined if given host belongs to the `&lt;NAME&gt;' environment. GUI groups hosts using this class. 
</ul>
   Administrator may customize this bundle as needed, adding or removing
environments defined (Nova does not have any built-in environment
names), changing rules for hosts selection and making any other
modifications, the only requirement for environments feature to work
is keeping aforementioned variables and classes defined. Note that the
environment name 'any' is reserved.

   <p>Default rules expect file `environment_$(promises.active)/promises.cf'
to exist and to contain bundle `agent main', this bundle is included
last from main promises.cf and should implement/include/use any
environment-specific rules.

<h3 class="section">10.1 What are virtualization and cloud computing?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Virtualization refers to the ability to run multiple host instances on
a single physical node. Cloud computing typically refers to what is
called `platform as a service', or deployment of virtual machines on
demand, often as an on-line service.

   <p>In this document, virtualization support refers specifically to
hypervisor technologies supported by the open source library layer <i>libvirt</i>
project, which includes interfaces for Xen, KVM, Vmware-ESX, and more. 
CFEngine thus integrates freely with other tools based on this library, such
as <i>virsh</i> and the <i>Virtual Manager</i> graphical user interface.

<h3 class="section">10.2 Why build virtualization support into CFEngine?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Virtualization engines (usually called supervisors or hypervisors) are
seeing an explosion of development. They exist as a number of projects
in various stages of maturity. The libvirt project was designed as
an integration layer based on an XML specification.

   <p>The tools for management are still quite primitive and require much
manual work. CFEngine has a unique role to play in maintaining desired
state in virtual machine systems.

   <p>In the cloud, virtual machines may be rented from remote commercial
providers, and managed as disposable resources. Convergent or
`self-healing' maintenance is an essential method for managing
machines that are geographically remote and awkward to access, e.g. 
machines in other time-zones that it is impractical to monitor by
legacy methods.

<h3 class="section">10.3 What can CFEngine do with virtual machines?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The simple answer is: anything that <i>libvirt</i> can do, with added
convergence to a desired state: that means, creating, destroying and
starting and stopping machines. By starting virtual machines through
CFEngine, you can be sure that a given `virtual guest' is running on
one and only one physical host, thus avoiding conflicts that are
difficult to detect with centralized systems.

   <p>CFEngine does not support everything that libvirt does &ndash; it offers a
simplified interface that is meant for robustness, stability and
hands-free repeatability.

CFEngine does not use libvirt's TLS based web communication layer.  It

`live migration' of virtual machines.

       environment_resources => virt_xml,
       environment_type      => "xen",
       environment_host      => "my_physical_computer", # ipv4_10_1_2_3
       environment_state     => "create";
}

#######################################################

body environment_resources virt_xml

env_spec_file => "/srv/xen/centos5-libvirt-create.xml";
}

</pre>

     <ul>
<li>The promiser (in this case &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myUbuntu</span></samp>&rsquo;) is the name of the virtual
machine. This should be a unique identifier, as we need to be able to
refer to machines uniquely.

     <li>The environment host is the name of the computer that
is the host for the virtual machine.

     <li>Normally when we want to ensure something on a machine, we use classes
to decide where the promise will be made. For environments, however,
we need to make promises about the uniqueness of the machine. When you
make a machine instance you normally want it to be running on one and
only one host. So you want <i>every</i> machine to make a promise. On the
environment's host, you want to promise that the environment is
running, and on every other machine you want to promise that it is
not. In CFEngine, you simply include a unique class belonging to host
in the promise using <code>environment_host</code> and CFEngine assumes that
rest. Unique classes might include
          <ul>
<li>Hostname class e.g. <code>myhost_CFEngine_com</code>
<li>IP address class e.g. <code>ipv4_123_456_789_123</code>
</ul>
     </ul>

   <p>An alternative way to write this example is to quote the XML
specification in CFEngine directly. This has a few advantages: you can
re-use the data and use it as a template, filling in
CFEngine-variables. You can thus adapt the configuration using
CFEngine's classes.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent my_vm_cloud

   "myUbuntu" # the running instance name, defined in XML
       environment_resources => virt_xml("$(this.promiser)"),

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine currently supports virtualization only through libvirt, so it supports
those technologies that libvirt supports. Currently this includes  most popular
technologies. You must choose the type of monitor that is to be responsible for
keeping the environment promise. In CFEngine, you should choose between a
machine environment or network environment of the following types:
     <dl>
<dt><code>xen</code><dd>A Xen hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>kvm</code><dd>A KVM hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>esx</code><dd>A VMware hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>test</code><dd>The libvirt test-hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>xen_net</code><dd>A Xen hypervisor virtual network. 
<br><dt><code>kvm_net</code><dd>A KVM hypervisor virtual network
<br><dt><code>esx_net</code><dd>An ESX/VMWare hypervisor virtual network. 
<br><dt><code>test_net</code><dd>The test hypervisor virtual network. 
<br><dt><code>zone</code><dd>A Solaris zone (future development)
<br><dt><code>ec2</code><dd>An Amazon EC2 instance (future development)
<br><dt><code>eucalyptus</code><dd>A Eucalyptus instance (future development)
</dl>

   <p>Once again, you must consult the libvirt documentation for details.

Libvirt recognizes a number of distinct states are transliterated into CFEngine

<dt><code>create</code><dd>Build and start an environment. 
<br><dt><code>delete</code><dd>Halt and remove runtime resources associated with an environment.

<br><dt><code>suspended</code><dd>An existing environment is in a `paused' state. 
<br><dt><code>down</code><dd>An existing environment is in a halted state.

wherever the  <code>environment_host</code> class is true, and
suspended or down elsewhere.

</div>

<h3 class="section">10.7 Example deployment</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Prerequisites: you need to make a `disk image' for the machine, or a
virtual disk of blocks that can be allocated. This image does not have to
contain any data, it will simply as a block device for the VM. You
can then install it by booting the machine from a network image, like a
PXE/kickstart installation.

   <p>If you want to allocate disk blocks as the file grows, you can create
a file with a hole. The following command will creates a file of
2048MB, but the actual data blocks are allocated in a lazy fashion:

<pre class="verbatim">
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/srv/xen/my.img oflag=direct bs=1M seek=2047 count=1

</pre>
To reserve all the data blocks right away:
<pre class="verbatim">
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/srv/xen/my.img oflag=direct bs=1M count=2048

</pre>

   <p>Libvirt uses an XML file format that cannot be circumvented. CFEngine
promises to honor the promises that are expressed in this file, as in
the examples above.  You need to find out about this file format from
the libvirt website.  To get CFEngine to Honor these promises, you
point it to the specification that it should promise using
<code>spec_file</code>.

   <p>You need to set up a network for virtual machines to communicate with
the outside world. This can also be done with CFEngine, using the
network promise types to build a bridge into a virtual network.

   <p>Then just run CFEngine to start, stop or manage the virtual environments on
each localhost. Run in verbose mode to see how CFEngine maintains the states
convergently.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Content-Driven Policies</h2>

<p>In Nova 2.0, Content-Driven Policies (CDP) were introduced to make
policy management easier. In contrast to policies written in the
CFEngine language, these are semi-colon separated fields in a text
file that the user just fills with content. All the underlying
enforcement and reporting are taken care of automatically by Nova.

   <p>For example, to manage three Windows services, the following
services-CDP will suffice.

<pre class="verbatim"># masterfiles/cdp_inputs/service_list.txt

Dnscache;stop;fix;windows
ALG;start;warn;windows
RemoteRegistry;start;fix;Windows_Server_2008

</pre>

   <p>The meanings of the fields are different depending of the CDP-type,
but explained in the file header. With these three lines, we ensure
the correct status of three services on all our Windows machines and
are given specialized reports on the outcome. The Content-Driven
Policy services report is shown below.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="cdp_services_report.png" alt="The Content-Driven Policy services report"></div>

<h3 class="section">11.1 Benefits of Content-Driven Policies</h3>

<p>As seen in the example above, Content-Driven Policies are easy to
write and maintain, especially for users unfamiliar with the CFEngine
language. They are designed to capture the essence of a specific,
popular use of CFEngine, and make it easier. For example, the services
Content-Driven Policy above has the following equivalent in the
CFEngine language.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     bundle agent service_example
     {
     services:
     
       "Dnscache"
         comment            =&gt; "Check services status of Dnscache",
         handle             =&gt; "srv_Dnscache_windows",
         service_policy     =&gt; "stop",
         service_method     =&gt; force_deps,
         action             =&gt; policy("fix"),
         ifvarclass         =&gt; "windows";
     
       "ALG"
         comment            =&gt; "Check services status of ALG",
         handle             =&gt; "srv_ALG_windows",
         service_policy     =&gt; "start",
         service_method     =&gt; force_deps,
         action             =&gt; policy("warn"),
         ifvarclass         =&gt; "windows";
     
       "RemoteRegistry"
         comment            =&gt; "Check services status of ALG",
         handle             =&gt; "srv_ALG_windows",
         service_policy     =&gt; "start",
         service_method     =&gt; force_deps,
         action             =&gt; policy("fix"),
         ifvarclass         =&gt; "Windows_Server_2008";
     
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>Writing this policy is clearly more time-consuming and error-prone. On
the other hand, it allows for much more flexibility than Content-Driven
Policies, when that is needed.

   <p>CFEngine provides Content-Driven Policies to cover mainstream
management tasks like the following.

     <ul>
<li>File change/difference management
<li>Service management
<li>Database management
<li>Application / script management
</ul>

<h3 class="section">11.2 Getting started</h3>

<p>All the CDP input files are located in
<code>/var/cfengine/masterfiles/cdp_inputs</code> on your policy hub. Nova
is bundled with some examples, but ensure to <em>edit the examples
before enabling them</em>.

   <p>To enable all the CDPs located in <code>cdp_inputs/</code>, open
<code>promises.cf</code> in your masterfiles directory. Remove the comment
(<code>#</code>) in front of the cdp entries in <code>bundlesequence</code> and
<code>inputs</code>, to make it look like the following.

<pre class="verbatim">bundlesequence => {
                  "def",
                  "cfengine_management",
                  "service_catalogue",
                  "cdp",
...

        inputs => {
...
                  "cdp_lib/cdp.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_acls.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_registry.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_file_changes.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_file_diffs.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_services.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_commands.cf",
...
</pre>

   <p>When the hosts start reporting back on the outcome of these policies
(usually within 10 minutes), you can view the reports from your
Knowledge Map on the policy hub. Go to the <code>Status</code> tab, find the
Content-Driven Policies drop-down, select the CDP type
(e.g. <code>Services</code>) and click <code>Generate</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Windows-specific features in Nova</h2>

<p>In this section, we will explore the Windows-specific features of the
native Windows version of CFEngine Nova, and how it integrates with
Windows. We will also consider features that are more interesting or
popular on Windows than on other platforms.

   <p>Feature highlights include Windows service management and integration,
event logging, Windows registry repair, and fine-tuned file security
support through access control lists. See the sections on databases
and ACLs to find information on Windows registry repair and NTFS ACLs,
respectively. We will look at some of the other added features next.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Windows service management</h3>

<p>CFEngine Nova can maintain complete control of the state of all
Windows services, in addition to Unix daemons. Services prone to
security issues or errors can easily be given a disabled state.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winservice-disabled_policy.png" alt="Disabled Windows service"></div>

   <p>A service can also be given a running state, in which case CFEngine
Nova ensures that it is running, and starts it if it is not, with
parameters if desired. More advanced policy options are also
available, including support for starting and stopping dependencies,
and configuring when the services should be started (e.g. only when
they are being used).

   <p>Furthermore, the CFEngine executor in Nova now runs as a Windows
service itself. This means it runs in the background an starts with
Windows, before any user logs in. It can be configured, started and
stopped from the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; listing in Windows.

   <p>Note that the name of a service in Windows may be different from its
&ldquo;Display name&rdquo;. CFEngine Nova policies use the name, not the display
name, due to the need of uniqueness.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winservice-properties_name.png" alt="Windows service name and Display name"></div>

<h3 class="section">12.2 Windows event logging</h3>

<p>Event logs are the Windows counterpart to syslog from Unix. The main
difference is that event logs aim to group similar log messages,
giving each group an event id.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winevent-repaired-acl-closeup.png" alt="Promise repaired in Event Viewer"></div>

   <p>A program that creates logs, such as CFEngine Nova, must define the
possible event IDs, and their meaning. In many applications, only one
event id is defined, a generic log message. However, CFEngine Nova
defines the following range of event IDs, which allows for automatic
handling of log messages.

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="40%">Description </th><th valign="top" width="20%">Event ID </th><th valign="top" width="20%">Type
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise kept </td><td valign="top" width="20%">100 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise repaired </td><td valign="top" width="20%">101 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise not repaired due warn only policy </td><td valign="top" width="20%">102 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Error
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise not repaired due to error </td><td valign="top" width="20%">103 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Error
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Report promise </td><td valign="top" width="20%">104 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic information </td><td valign="top" width="20%">105 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic verbose </td><td valign="top" width="20%">106 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic warning </td><td valign="top" width="20%">107 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Warning
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic error </td><td valign="top" width="20%">108 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Error
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winevent-notkept-storage.png" alt="Promise not kept in Event Viewer"></div>

   <p>The Nova event logs can be found under the &ldquo;System&rdquo; logs.  Almost
all monitoring products for Windows supports reading event logs, and
they can thus monitor logs from CFEngine Nova as well. This makes it
possible to do more advanced querying on the status of a machine
running CFEngine Nova, e.g. to show all promises that have not been
kept in a certain time interval. However, we recommend using the
Knowledge Map to do more advanced things, as it is specifically made
for this purpose and supports all operating systems that CFEngine runs
on.

<h3 class="section">12.3 Windows special variables</h3>

<p>Three new special variables have been added to the Windows version of
CFEngine Nova.

     <ul>
<li><code>sys.windir</code> contains the Windows directory,
e.g. &ldquo;C:\WINDOWS&rdquo;.

     <li><code>sys.winsysdir</code> contains the Windows system directory,
e.g. &ldquo;C:\WINDOWS\system32&rdquo;.

     <li><code>sys.winprogdir</code> contains the program files directory,
e.g. &ldquo;C:\Program Files&rdquo;.

   </ul>

   <p>Note that these variables are not statically coded, but retrieved from
the current system. For example, <code>sys.winprogdir</code> is often
different on Windows versions in distinct languages.

<h3 class="section">12.4 Windows hard classes</h3>

<p>The Windows version of CFEngine Nova defines hard classes to pinpoint
the exact version of Windows that it is running on, the service pack
version and if it's a server or workstation.

   <p>First of all, the class <code>windows</code> is defined on all Windows
platforms. For Windows workstations, such as Windows XP,
<code>WinWorkstation</code> is defined. On Windows servers, such as Windows
Server 2003, <code>WinServer</code> is defined. In addition, if the server
is a domain controller, <code>DomainController</code> is defined. Note that
if <code>DomainController</code> is defined, then <code>WinServer</code> is also
defined, for natural reasons.

   <p>The class <code>Service_Pack_X_Y</code> is defined according to the service
pack version. For example, at the time of writing,
<code>Service_Pack_3_0</code> is set on an updated Windows XP operating
system.

   <p>To allow taking specific actions on different Windows versions, one
of the following hard classes is defined.

     <ul>
<li><code>Windows_7</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2008_R2</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2008</code>
<li><code>Windows_Vista</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2003_R2</code>
<li><code>Windows_Home_Server</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2003</code>
<li><code>Windows_XP_Professional_x64_Edition</code>
<li><code>Windows_XP</code>
<li><code>Windows_2000</code>
</ul>

   <p>Note that all defined hard classes for a given system is shown by
running <code>cf-promises -v</code>.

<h3 class="section">12.5 Notes on windows policies</h3>

<p>A potential problem source when writing policies for windows is that
paths to executables often contain spaces. This makes it impossible
for CFEngine to know where the executable ends and the parameters to
it starts. To solve this, we place escaped quotes around the
executable.

   <p>Additionally, Windows does not support that processes start themselves
in in the background (i.e. fork off a child process in the Unix
world). The result is that CFEngine is always waiting for the commands
to finish execution before checking the next promise. To avoid this,
use the background attribute in the action body-part.

   <p>Both these things are demonstrated in the following example.

<pre class="verbatim">
body common control
{
bundlesequence  => { "main" };
}

bundle agent main
{
commands:

"\"C:\Program Files\Some Dir\program name.bat\" --silent --batch"
  action => background;
}

body action background
{
background => "true";
}

</pre>

   <p>Finally, one should note that Windows lacks support for certain
features that are utilized in Unix versions of CFEngine. These include
symbolic links, file groups, user and group identifiers.

   <p>Thus, the parts of promises containing these features will be
ignored. For example, the <code>getgid()</code> function does not return
anything on Windows. The reference manual documents exactly which
promises are ignored and not.  Also, <code>cf-agent</code> from CFEngine
Nova prints warning messages on ignored attributes when run in verbose
mode.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Major version 3</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> CFEngine supports integration with Subversion
through its Mission Portal, but any versioning system can of course be
used.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> CFEngine and version control will document <i>what</i>
the changes are, but what is usually missing from user documentation
is an explanation of the reasoning behind the change. This is most
valuable when trying to diagnose and debug changes later.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> There is a known issue with
the algorithm for determining whether or not there are actual data to be shown
for a given metric. Noise and sporadic port connections might result in
the Mission Portal showing strange looking graphs with blanks and holes. 
Alternative approaches to auto-detecting data are being investigated for
future releases.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-5" href="#fnd-5">5</a>]</small> A full multi-user version will be part of CFEngine
Constellation</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-6" href="#fnd-6">6</a>]</small> Often it is enough to be able to
ask a relevant question and feel that one has a voice, while experts are taking care of the details.</p>
