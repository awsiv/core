<h3 class="section">1.1 Managing diverse and challenging environments seamlessly and invisibly</h3>

<p>The future is never far away. 
Our dream of a future in which smart computing devices are embedded into
the very fabric of our environment has crept slowly into being. Today,
smart operating systems like Linux and Windows are used on embedded devices
and mobile phones. 
Mark Weiser of Xerox PARC once wrote:

   <blockquote>
<i>"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave
themselves into the fabric of every day life until they are
indistinguishable from it."</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>Today many are talking about Cloud Computing as another manifestation
of this dream, in which computing service is not only everywhere, but
nowhere &ndash; or more correctly, spread out across the planet in
data centers, instead of our offices and homes. This is one aspect of
making computing into something we take for granted. At the
foundations of any such technology are the tools required to implement
mass configuration with surgical precision. CFEngine is such a tool.

   <p>CFEngine was designed to enable scalable configuration management, for
the
whole system life-cycle, in any kind of environment. 
Almost every other system for configuration assumes that there will be
a reliable network in place and that changes will be pushed out
top-down from an authoritative node. Those systems are useless in
environments like

     <ul>
<li>Mobile systems with partial or unreliable connectivity (e.g. a
submarine). 
<li>Systems where bandwidths are very low (e.g. a satellite or space
probe). 
<li>Systems where computing power is very low (e.g. ad hoc sensors
or kitchen appliances). 
</ul>

   <p>CFEngine does not need reliable infrastructure. It works
opportunistically in almost any environment, using few resources. It
has few software dependencies.  So, not only does it work in all of the
traditional fixed-plan scenarios, but it is capable of working in
totally ad hoc deployment: an temporary incident room, a submarine
drifting on and off line, a satellite or a robot explorer.

   <p>One could argue `well I don't need that kind of system, because my
network is reliable'. However, your network is not as reliable as you
think, and mobility is an increasingly important topic. Even with a
very strong redundant network, the services that support the network
can be paralyzed by any of a number of failed dependencies or
mishaps. It is crucial in a modern pervasive environment that systems
remain available, fault tolerant and as far as possible independent of
external requirements. This is how to build scalable and reliable
services.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Managing expectations - a theory of promises</h3>

<p>One of the hardest things in management is to make everyone aware of
their roles and tasks, and to be able to rely on others to do the same. 
<i>Trust</i> is an economic time-saver. If you can't trust you have to
verify,
and that is expensive.

   <p>To improve trust we make promises. A promise is the documentation of an
intention to act or behave in some manner. This is what we need to
learn to
trust systems, no matter whether they are machines or humans.

   <p>One CFEngine user once said to me, that the thing that had helped him
the most in deploying CFEngine was its design based around voluntary
cooperation. &ldquo;Our main problems were not technical but political &ndash;
getting everyone to agree in all of our departments around the
world&rdquo;.  This was because, for all the technology, it is people who
make the decisions and people need to feel that the system is
empowering rather than disempowering them.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p>CFEngine works on a simple notion of promises. Everything in
CFEngine can be thought of as a promise to be kept by different
resources in the system.

   <p>Combining promises with patterns to describe where and when
promises should apply is what CFEngine is all about.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Why automation?</h3>

<p>Humans are good at making decisions and awful at reliable
implementation.  Machines are pitiful at making decisions and very
good at reliable implementation. It makes sense to let each side do
the job that they are good at.

   <p>The main problem in managing systems is a loss of self-discipline. 
Discipline
does not imply that order have to be barked from a central command. It
only requires that every part of the system knows its job and carries
is out seamlessly and flawlessly.

   <p>Skilled workers tend to think that it is enough to be smart. In fact
this is wrong: smart people tend to be problem solvers and will
happily solve the same problem many times, wasting time and
effort. Moreover, human intervention is often based on panic and lack
of understanding so every time someone logs onto a system by hand,
they jeopardize everyone's understanding of the system.  Only the
self-discipline of stable procedures leads to predictability.

   <p>Ad hoc changes are bad because:
     <ul>
<li>Others have no idea what happened. 
<li>There is no record of changes or intentions. 
<li>A scar is left from the change. 
</ul>

   <p>People often rile against automation saying that it dehumanizes their
work.  In fact the opposite is true: forcing humans to do the work of
machines, in repetitive and reliable ways is what dehumanizes people. 
The only way to make progress with a bad habit is to recognize it and
be willing to abandon the habit.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Scaling up</h3>

<p>In the past, the only way to scale up system numbers was to make all
systems identical. This is no longer true.

   <p>In the late 1960s journalist and futurist Alvin Toffler sketched a
pretty compelling vision of the western world and its post-industrial
future. His book Future Shock, which appeared in 1970, was really a
reaction to the cold-war fears about a communist industrial state in
which mass production made everything and everyone identical and
indistinguishable.  His book was really a rebuttal to all those who
argued that industrialization and mass production implied that
everything had to be exactly the same, and I recommend reading it - it
is very well written and has many lessons for us today. But from his
rather long diatribe, I wrote down a single sentence which for me sums
up the lesson that we have failed to learn:

   <blockquote>
<i>"As technology becomes more sophisticated, the cost of introducing
variations declines."</i>
</blockquote>

   <p>In other words, any half-decent technology for mass production would
help us to be more sophisticated and multifaceted, not less. 
In an age when you can get business cards printed on demand from an
ATM at the airport, and personalized coffee mugs in the blink of an
eye, there is no reason to perpetuate the myth that massive
infrastructure requires monolithic replication, and yet people still
do. Network engineers do, and system administrators do. They even say
that this is essential for scalability.

   <p>The importance of Toffler's message was that the economics of mass
production are not at odds with the economics of adaptation, but 40
years later, we are still re-learning that lesson.

<h3 class="section">1.5 How do <i>you</i> view CFEngine?</h3>

<p>CFEngine is a framework. It is not so complex, but it is certainly
extensive. 
Often when trying to describe CFEngine, it seems that there is too
much to
tell and it is hard to convey in a simple way what the software can do. 
The picture below shows a few ways in which you can think of CFEngine.

<div align="center"><img src="boxes.png" alt="CFEngine application areas"></div>

   <p>For many users, CFEngine is simply a configuration tool &ndash;
i.e. software for deploying and patching systems according to a
policy. Policy is described using promises &ndash; indeed, every statement
in CFEngine 3 is a promise to be kept at some time or location.  More
than this, however, CFEngine is not like most automation tools that
`roll out' an image of some software once and hope for the best. Every
promise that you make in CFEngine is continuously verified and
maintained. It is not a one-off operation, but an encapsulated process
that repairs itself should anything deviate from the policy.

   <p>That clearly places CFEngine in the realm of automation, which often
begs the question: so it's just another scripting language? Certainly
CFEngine contains a powerful scripting language, but it is not like
any other. CFEngine is not a low level language like Perl, Python or
Ruby; it is a language of promises, in which you express very high
level intentions about the system and the inner details figure out the
algorithms needed to implement the result. We'll return to this below.

   <p>For many, CFEngine is a tool for implementing security hardening
procedures on systems, and monitoring them continuously thereafter. 
This is certainly a major application area. CFEngine has a reputation
for being reliable and secure. That is because its basic design is
secure: it is not possible to send information about policy to
CFEngine from outside the system. If access has been granted, it is
only possible to send a few simple protocol requests of limited length
to the server. This makes the design safer than most firewalls. 
Most servers fail security tests because it is possible to send
data to them.

   <p>The ability to describe almost any kind of policy for a system means
that we can suggest promises that a system should make and comply
with.  Thus CFEngine can also be thought of as a compliance engine. 
It is easily used to comply with frameworks like SOX, `EUROSOX' (the
EU 8th Data Directive), ITIL and standards like ISO 17799, ISO 20000,
etc.

   <p>Finally, although CFEngine was not initially conceived for monitoring,
it
contains one of the most flexible and lightweight monitoring engines
around. You can extract data about system configuration, usage,
resources and log data and turn this into readable reports. CFEngine's
ability to discover and extract information about the system, combined
with its reporting means that you can turn the system into a simple
Configuration Management Database. In the Community edition,
monitoring is a zero-touch background process. With CFEngine
commercial extensions, there is almost no limit to the kind of
monitoring promises you can make, and without the embarrassing resource
spikes that many monitoring systems produce.

   <p>Above all, CFEngine is aimed to promote human understanding of complex
processes. Its promises are easily documentable using comments that
the system remembers and reminds us about in error reporting. It hides
irrelevant and transitory details of implementation so that the
<i>intentions</i> behind the promises are highlighted for all to see. 
This means that the knowledge of your organization can be encoded into
the CFEngine language.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>WHY DOES KNOWLEDGE MATTER? There are two reasons: the first is that
technical descriptions are hard to remember. You might understand
your configuration decisions when you are writing them, but a few
months later when something goes wrong, you will probably have forgotten
what you were thinking. That costs you time and effort to diagnose. 
The second reason is that organizations are fragile to the loss
of those individuals who code policy. If they leave, often there is
no one left who can understand or fix the system. Only with proper
documentation is it possible to immunize against loss.</i>

build them and what they are for.

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Installation</h3>

<p>To install CFEngine, you will need a few packages.  You require:

     <dl>
<dt><b>OpenSSL</b><dd>Open source Secure Sockets Layer for encryption.<br>URL: <a href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a>
<br><dt><b>Tokyo Cabinet</b><span class="roman"> (version 1.4.42 or later)</span><dd>Lightweight flat-file database system.<br>URL: <a href="http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/">http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/</a>
<br><dt><b>PCRE</b><dd>Perl Compatible Regular Expression library.<br>URL: <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">http://www.pcre.org/</a>

     <br><dt><dd>On Windows machines, you need to install the basic Cygwin DLL from
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>
in order to run CFEngine. 
</dl>

   <p>Additional functionality (some of which is available only in
commercial extensions) also becomes available if other libraries are
present, e.g.  OpenLDAP, client libraries for MySQL and PostgreSQL,
etc. It is possible to run CFEngine without these, but related
functionality will be missing.

   <p>Unless you have purchased ready-to-run binaries, or are using a
package distribution, you will need to compile CFEngine. For this you
will also need a build environment with <code>gcc</code>, <code>flex</code>,
and <code>bison</code>.

<p class="noindent">The preferred method of installation is then

<pre class="smallexample">     tar zxf CFEngine-x.x.x.tar.gz
     cd CFEngine-x.x.x
     ./configure
     make
     make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This results in binaries being installed in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/bin</span></samp>.

<div class="node">
<a name="Work-directory"></a>
<p><hr>
Next:&nbsp;<a rel="next" accesskey="n" href="#The-players">The players</a>,
Previous:&nbsp;<a rel="previous" accesskey="p" href="#Installation">Installation</a>,
Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#The-components-of-CFEngine">The components of CFEngine</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">2.2 The work directory</h3>

<p>CFEngine keeps a work space directory for its own use. The default
location for this is <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine</span></samp> when run as the root user, and
<code>~/.cfagent</code> for other users.

<!-- /@w --><pre class="smallexample">     /var/cfengine
     /var/cfengine/bin
     /var/cfengine/inputs
     /var/cfengine/outputs
</pre>
   <!-- chew end Work directory -->
   <p>A trusted cache of the input files must now be maintained in the
<samp><span class="file">inputs</span></samp> subdirectory. When CFEngine is invoked by the scheduler,
it expects to read only from this directory. It is up to the user to
keep this cache updated, on each host (this is arranged by the default
configuration files).

   <p>Unlike CFEngine 2, CFEngine 3 does not recognize the
<code>CF-INPUTS</code> environment variable.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">outputs</span></samp> directory is now a record of spooled run-reports. 
These
are often mailed to the administrator by <code>cf-execd</code>, or can be
copied
to another central location and viewed in an alternative browser.

<h3 class="section">2.3 The players</h3>

<p>A CFEngine system is something like an orchestra. 
It is composed of any number of computers (players), each of which has
its
own copy of the music and knows what to play. It might or might not have
a conductor to help coordinate the individual parts &ndash; that's up to you.

   <p>CFEngine's software agents run on each individual computer but can
communicate if they need to, as depicted the figure below. This means
you don't have to arrange risky login credentials to run your network
&ndash; and if something goes wrong with the communications network,
CFEngine is where it needs to be to repair or protect the system
during the outage.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="components.png" alt="CFEngine components"></div>

   <p>If the network is not working, CFEngine just skips these parts and
continues
with what it can do. It is fault tolerant and opportunistic.

     <dl>
<dt><em>cf-promises</em><dd>The promise verifier and compiler. This is used to pre-check a set of
configuration promises before attempting to execute.

     <br><dt><em>cf-agent</em><dd>
This is the instigator of change. The agent is the part of CFEngine
that manipulates
system resources.

     <br><dt><em>cf-serverd</em><dd>
The server is able to share files and receive requests to execute
existing policy on an individual machine. It is not possible to send
(push) new information to CFEngine from outside.

     <br><dt><em>cf-execd</em><dd>
This is a scheduling daemon (which can either supplement or replace
<code>cron</code>). It also works as a wrapper, executing and collecting the
output of <code>cf-agent</code> and E-mailing it if necessary to a system
account.

     <br><dt><em>cf-runagent</em><dd>
This is a helper program that can talk to <code>cf-serverd</code> and
request that it execute <code>cf-agent</code> with its existing policy. It
can thus be used to simulate a push of changes to CFEngine hosts, if
their policy includes that they check for updates.

     <br><dt><em>cf-report</em><dd>
This generates summary and other reports in a variety of formats for
export or integration with other systems.

     <br><dt><em>cf-know</em><dd>
This agent can generate an ISO standard Topic Map from a number of
promises about system knowledge. It is used for rendering documentation
as a `semantic web'.

<h3 class="section">2.4 About the CFEngine architecture</h3>

<p>This section explains how CFEngine will operate autonomously in a
network, under your guidance.  If your site is large (thousands of
servers) you should spend some time discussing with CFEngine experts
how to tune this description to your environment as <em>scale</em>
requires you to have more infrastructure, and a potentially more
complicated configuration. The essence of any CFEngine deployment
is the same.

   <p>There are four commonly cited phases in managing systems, summarized
as follows:

     <ul>
<li>Build
<li>Deploy
<li>Manage
<li>Audit
</ul>

   <p>These separate phases originate with a model of system management
based on transactional changes.  CFEngine's conception of management
is somewhat different, as transaction processing is not a good model for
system management, but we can use this template to see how
CFEngine works differently.

     <dl>
<dt><em>Build</em><dd>A system is based on a number of decisions and resources that need to
be `built' before they can be implemented. Building the trusted
foundations of a system is the key to guiding its development.  You
don't need to decide every detail, just enough to build trust and
predictability into your system.

     <p>In CFEngine, what you build is a template of proposed promises for the
machines in an organization such that, if the machines all make and
keep these promises, the system will function seamlessly as
planned. This is how it works in a human organization, and this is how
is works for computers too.

     <br><dt><em>Deploy</em><dd>Deploying really means implementing the policy that was already
decided.  In transaction systems, one tries to push out changes one by
one, hence `deploying' the decision. In CFEngine you simply publish
your policy (in CFEngine parlance these are `promise proposals') and
the machines see the new proposals and can adjust accordingly. Each
machine runs an agent that is capable of implementing policies and
maintaining them over time without further assistance.

     <br><dt><em>Manage</em><dd>Once a decision is made, unplanned events will occur. Such
incidents traditionally set off alarms and humans rush to make new
transactions
to repair them. In CFEngine, the autonomous agent manages the system,
and you only have to deal with rare events that cannot be dealt with
automatically.

     <br><dt><em>Audit</em><dd>In traditional configuration systems, the outcome is far from clear
after a one-shot transaction, so one audits the system
to determine to discover what actually happened. In CFEngine, changes
are not just initiated once, but locally audited and maintained. 
Decision outcomes are assured by design in CFEngine and maintained
automatically, so the main worry is managing conflicting
intentions. Users can sit back and examine regular reports of
compliance generated by the agents, without having to arrange
for new `roll out' transactions.

   </dl>

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<em>ROLL-OUT and ROLL-BACK?  You should not think of CFEngine as a
roll-out system, i.e. one that attempts to force out absolute changes
and perhaps reverse them in case of error. Roll-out and roll-back are
theoretically flawed concepts that only sometimes work in practice. 
With CFEngine, you publish a sequences of policy revisions, always
moving forward (because like it or not, time only goes in one
direction).  All of the desired-state changes are managed locally by
each individual computer, and continuously repaired to ensure on-going
compliance with policy. </em>

<h3 class="section">2.5 The policy decision flow</h3>

<p>CFEngine does not make absolute choices for you, like other
tools. Almost everything about its behaviour is matter of policy and
can be changed.  However, a structure for use, like the following, is
recommended (see the following figure).

   <p>In order to keep operations as simple as possible, CFEngine maintains
a private working directory on each machine referred to in
documentation as WORKDIR and in policy by the variable
<code>$(sys.workdir)</code>. By default, this is located at
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">C:\var\CFEngine</span></samp>. It contains everything
CFEngine needs to run.

   <p>The figure below shows how decisions flow through the parts of a system.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="arch.png" alt="The CFEngine architecture"></div>

     <ul>
<li>It makes sense to have a single point of coordination.  Decisions are
therefore usually made in a single location (the Policy Definition
Point).  The history of decisions and changes can be tracked by a
version control system of your choice (e.g. Subversion, CVS, etc.).

     <li>Decisions are made by editing CFEngine's policy file
<samp><span class="file">promises.cf</span></samp> (or one of its included sub-files). This process is
carried out off-line.

     <li>Once decisions have been formalized and coded, this new policy is
copied <em>manually</em> (a human decision) to a <em>decision
distribution point</em>, which by default is located in the directory
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> on all policy distribution servers.

     <p>In this introduction, we shall assume that there is only one central
policy distribution server, a specially-appointed server which is
referred to simple as the <code>policy server</code>.

     <li>Every client machine contacts the policy server and downloads these
updates. The policy server can be replicated if the number of clients
is very large, but we shall assume here that there is only one policy
server. 
</ul>

   <p>Once a client machine has a copy of the policy, it extracts only those
promise proposals that are relevant to it, and implements any changes
without human assistance.  This is how CFEngine manages change.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p><em>WHY DO THIS? CFEngine tries to minimize dependencies by decoupling
processes. By following this pull-based architecture, CFEngine will
tolerate network outages and will recover from deployment errors
easily. By placing the burden of responsibility for decision at the
top, and for implementation at the bottom, we avoid needless fragility
and keep two independent quality assurance processes apart.</em>

<h3 class="section">2.6 Getting started with the Community Edition</h3>

<p>The quickest way to get started with CFEngine is to download and install binary packages, available from <a href="http://cfengine.com/inside/myspace">http://cfengine.com/inside/myspace</a>. Installing and bootstrapping these is a trivial operation, putting you two steps away from testing your first CFEngine policies.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Note: There is a bug in Community 3.3.0 where the default policy files are not copied to <code>/var/cfengine/masterfiles</code> upon bootstrap. Workaround consists in manually copying these files before bootstrapping:
<pre class="verbatim">cp /var/cfengine/share/CoreBase/*.cf /var/cfengine/masterfiles/
</pre>
This will be corrected in a bugfix release coming soon. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>This procedure applies to all hosts, but you should bootstrap the hub (policy server) first. Find the hostname or IP address of the hub, here we assume the address is '123.456.789.123' (do not bootstrap with a localhost address).
<pre class="verbatim">
   host# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123

</pre>

   <p>CFEngine will output diagnostic information upon bootstrap (written to command line and syslog; cf-agent will also return a value: ERROR: 1, SUCCESS: 0). Error messages will be displayed if bootstrapping failed, pursue these to get and indication of what went wrong and correct accordingly. If all is well you should see the following in the output:

<pre class="verbatim">
-> Bootstrap to 123.456.789.123 completed successfully

</pre>

   <p>As an alternative to installing binary packages, the following steps outline the procedure when you have built from source (available from <a href="http://cfengine.com/source_code">http://cfengine.com/source_code</a>). You will then need to copy the distributed policy files that were installed in
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/share/CoreBase/</span></samp> to a policy distribution point, like
this:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Decide on your policy server.

     <li>Become root or Administrator on that server.

     <li>Create the policy source directory and populate the cache:
     <pre class="smallexample">             host# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-key
             host# cp /var/cfengine/share/CoreBase/*.cf /var/cfengine/masterfiles/
             host# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
</pre>
     </ol>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
CFEngine should be up and running on your system after the bootstrap. It will copy its default policy files into <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> on the hub (policy server) provided that the directory is empty (fresh install). This directory is the definition point for your policy, meaning that clients will contact the hub and copy these files to their <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp> directory. Note that the policy hub also works as a client against itself, so it too will copy from <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp>. You should browse the files in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> to see what they contain, and perhaps make some alterations to adapt to your environment.

   <p>To see which CFEngine processes are running:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     host# ps waux | grep cf-
     
</pre>
   <p>Note: If you have manually configured a different location for the
CFEngine work directory,
you will need to adapt these lines above to replace <samp><span class="file">/var/
CFEngine</span></samp> with the path
you have configured; e.g. Debian based packages feel that <samp><span class="file">/var/
lib/CFEngine</span></samp>
is the right location for this.

<p>To emphasize the fact that CFEngine is not an imperative programming

CFEngine uses two concepts throughout: bundles and bodies.

<h3 class="section">3.1 Bodies</h3>

<p>Promises are the fundamental statements in CFEngine. Promises are the policy atoms. 
If there is no promise, nothing happens.

   <p>However, promises can become quite complicated and readability becomes
an issue, so it is useful to have a way of breaking them down into independent
components. The structure of a promise is this:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Promiser</i><dd>This is the object that formally makes the promise. It is always the <i>affected object</i>,
since objects can only make promises about their own state or behavior in CFEngine.

     <br><dt><i>Promisee (optional)</i><dd>This is a possible stakeholder, someone who is interested in the outcome of the
promise. It is used as documentation, and it is used for reasoning in the commercial
CFEngine product.

     <br><dt><i>Promise body</i><dd>Everything else about a promise is defined in the body of the promise. 
We use this word in the sense of `body of a contract' or the `body of a document'
(like <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>) tags in HTML, for example.

     <p>A promise body is a list of declarations of the following form:

     <pre class="verbatim">     CFEngine_attribute_type => user_defined_value or template
</pre>

   </dl>

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Body-parts">Body parts</a>
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Control-bodies">Control bodies</a>
</ul>

<div class="node">

<p><hr>
Next:&nbsp;<a rel="next" accesskey="n" href="#Control-bodies">Control bodies</a>,
Previous:&nbsp;<a rel="previous" accesskey="p" href="#Bodies">Bodies</a>,
Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Bodies">Bodies</a>

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Body parts</h4>

<p>The CFEngine reserved word <code>body</code> is used to define
<i>parameterized templates</i> for bodies to hide the details of complex
promise specifications. For complex body lists, you must fill in a
body declaration as an `attachment' to the promise, e.g.

<pre class="verbatim">files:

  "/tmp/promiser"        # Promiser

<span class="red">    perms </span>=> myexample;  # The body is just one line, 
<span class="comment">                         # but needs an attachment
</span>

</pre>
The attachment is declared like this, with a `type' that matches the left
hand side of the declaration in the promise:
<pre class="verbatim">body perms myexample
{
<span class="red">mode </span>=><span class="green"> "644";</span>
<span class="red">owners </span>=> { "mark", "sarah", "angel" };
<span class="red">groups </span>=> { "users", "sysadmins", "mythical_beasts" };
}
</pre>
The structure is this:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     
       <var>promiser</var>
     
         <b>LVALUE</b> =&gt; <var>RVALUE</var>
     
     ..
     
     body <b>LVALUE</b> <var>RVALUE</var>
     {
     <b>LVALUE</b> =&gt; <var>RVALUE</var>;
     <b>LVALUE</b> =&gt; <var>RVALUE</var>;
     }
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Another way of looking at it is this:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="smallexample">     
       <var>promiser</var>
     
         <b>CFEngine_word</b> =&gt; <var>user_defined_value</var>
     
     ..
     
      body <b>CFEngine_word</b> <var>user_defined_value</var>
      {
      <b>CFEngine_word</b> =&gt; <var>user_defined_value</var>;
      <b>CFEngine_word</b> =&gt; <var>user_defined_value</var>;
      ...
      }
     
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

Body attachments are required items. You cannot choose to put the
attachments in-line. This is a lesson that was learned from CFEngine
2. Readability is quickly lost if too many details are placed in-line.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Control bodies</h4>

<p>Some promises in CFEngine are implicit. They are hard-coded into the program. 
For example, the fact that CFEngine looks for a number of files to read and
will execute them in a sequence is hard coded. You cannot change this. 
However, you can change the behavior of such promises by setting control
parameters. These are formally parts of the `promise body' for these hard-coded
promises, so we use the body structure to set them. Each agent has a special
body whose name is <code>control</code>; e.g.

<pre class="verbatim">body agent control
{
<span class="red">bundlesequence </span>=> { "test" };
}
</pre>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Bundles</h3>

<p>A bundle is a simple concept. A bundle is merely a collection of promises
in a `sub-routine-like' container. The purpose of bundles is to allow
you greater flexibility to break down the contents of your policies and
give them names. Bundles also allow you to re-use promise code by
parameterizing it.

   <p>Like bodies, bundles also have `types'. Bundles belong to the agent that
is used to keep the promises in the bundle. So <code>cf-agent</code> has bundles
declared as

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent my_name
{
}
</pre>

<p class="noindent">The <code>cf-serverd</code> program has bundles declared as:
<pre class="verbatim">bundle server my_name
{
}
</pre>
and so on.

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Bundle scope</h4>

<p>Variables and classes defined inside bundles are not directly visible outside. 
All variables in CFEngine are globally accessible, however if you refer to a variable
by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(unqualified)</span></samp>&rsquo;, then it is assumed to belong to the current bundle. To
access any other (scalar) variable, you must qualify the name using the name of
the bundle in which it is defined:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(bundle_name.qualified)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Some promise types, like <code>var</code>, <code>classes</code> may be made
by any agent. These are called <code>common</code> promises. Bundles of type <code>common</code>
are special. They may contain common promises. 
Classes defined in common bundles have global scope.

<h3 class="section">3.3 A simple syntax pattern</h3>

<p>The syntax of CFEngine follows a simple pattern in all cases. Once you have learned this pattern,
it will make sense anywhere in the program. The figure below illustrates
this pattern. Some words are reserved by CFEngine, and are used as types or categories
for talking about promises. Other words (in blue) are to be defined by you. 
Look at the examples and try to identify these patterns yourself.

<h2 class="chapter">4 How to execute and test a CFEngine policy</h2>

<p>You do not need root privilege to use CFEngine. Most experiments can
be safely tested as an ordinary user. You should spend some time
experimenting with small examples before setting out to configure a
system. To do that you should log onto your system as a regular
unprivileged user and set up:

<pre class="smallexample">     host$ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-key
     host$ cp /var/cfengine/bin/cf-* ~/.cfagent/bin
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">CFEngine wants to see copies of its binaries in its
work directory. For a regular user this lies in <samp><span class="file">~/.cfagent</span></samp>
rather than <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine</span></samp>. You should now be ready to go.

however, it is reassuring to see some output.

   <p>If you repeat the command immediately nothing will happen. But if you
wait
a minute, it will work again. Run the command in verbose mode (use the
<code>-v</code> or the <code>--verbose</code> switch) to see  why:

<pre class="smallexample">     /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --verbose -f ~/test.cf
</pre>
   <p>Now you will see:
<pre class="smallexample">     cf3&gt;    =========================================================
     cf3&gt;    reports in bundle hello (1)
     cf3&gt;    =========================================================
     cf3&gt;
     cf3&gt;  XX Nothing promised here [lock.hello.reports..Hello_worl] (0/1
     minutes elapsed)
     cf3&gt;
</pre>
   <p>This tells you that CFEngine believes it is too soon to try to keep
this promise
again. The time it sets on this is determined by the <code>ifelapsed</code>
parameter, which
can be set individually for every promise. You can also ask CFEngine
to ignore these
locks using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-K</span></samp>&rsquo; option.

   <p>Before the `Hello world' string, you see the class expression
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cfengine_3::</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This is how CFEngine makes decisions. The
promise to print the message will only apply if this condition is
true. To see that this class is true for the execution, look at the
verbose output from the command you just typed. You will see something
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     Defined Classes = ( any verbose_mode Tuesday Hr08 Morning Min48

   <p>i.e. a list of all the currently defined classes. Any one of these

(or a combination) could have been used to label the promise. 
That is the way CFEngine points to which promises will be kept in which
scenarios.

   <p>A final thing to note: if you try to process this using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cf-promises -r</span></samp>&rsquo; command, you will see something like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     atlas$ ~/LapTop/CFEngine3/trunk/src/cf-promises -r -f ~/test.cf

</pre>
   <p>You will see a summary of how CFEngine interprets the files, either in
HTML or text. All the CFEngine components will produce debugging file

(e.g. for the configuration file named <samp><span class="file">promise_output_agent.h</span></samp>,
they will create the files <samp><span class="file">promise_output_agent.html</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">promise_output_agent.txt</span></samp>).

<h3 class="section">4.2 Checking a file</h3>

<p>Type in the following example:

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body common control
</span>{
<span class="red">bundlesequence  </span>=> { "test" };
<span class="red">inputs </span>=> { "cfengine_stdlib.cf" };
}

<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">test</span>
{
<span class="red">files:
</span>
<span class="comment"># This is a throw-away comment, below is a full-bodied promise
</span>

"/tmp/testfile"                      # promiser

<span class="red">   comment </span>=><span class="green"> "This is for keeps...", # Live comment</span>
<span class="red">    create </span>=><span class="green"> "true",                 # Constraint 1</span>
<span class="red">     perms </span>=> m("612");               # Constraint 2, rw---x-w-

}

</pre>

   <p>In the CFEngine Community Open Promise-Body Library (CFEngine_stdlib.cf) is a library of
definitions that can be obtained from the CFEngine website. It should be
included in the <samp><span class="file">inputs</span></samp> directory and input as above. 
Within that file, the template &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined:
<pre class="verbatim"># This is a trivial body template, which makes parameterizing
<span class="comment"># the promise body tidier and re-usable
</span>

<span class="red">body perms</span> <span class="blue">m(x)</span>
{
<span class="red">mode </span>=><span class="green"> "$(x)";</span>
}

</pre>
This example shows how additional attributes are added to the body of
the promise. The right hand side of the <code>perms</code> declaration is a
template which we have called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">m()</span></samp>&rsquo;, which uses a parameter.  The
template is defined below the bundle of promises that uses it, showing
how we can create re-usable sets of parameters. In this case, the
example is trivial, but we have barely begun. When things get more
sophisticated, we shall hide a huge amount of detail in these
parameters, thus keeping the main promise uncluttered and its
intention clear.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p>In every `promise constraint' of the form &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">left-hand-side =&gt;
right-hand-side</span></samp>&rsquo;, the left hand side is a CFEngine reserved word, and
the right hand side is a decision you make, possibly expressed in
terms of standard templates.

   </td></tr></table>

   <p>Now execute <code>cf-agent</code> with this promise:
<pre class="smallexample">     <b>host$</b> /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -f /tmp/test.cf -I
     -&gt; Object /tmp/testfile had permission 600, changed it to 612
     
     <b>host$</b> ls -l /tmp/testfile
     -rw---x-w- 1 mark users 33 2009-06-30 06:06 /tmp/testfile
</pre>
   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo; flag tells CFEngine to `inform' us about changes only. 
This provides a digestible amount of output that is more than the
default (which is to only report un-fixable problems or explicit
reports).  We see that CFEngine creates the file as ordered, and sets
the permissions appropriately. Now try to change the permissions:
<pre class="smallexample">     <b>host$</b> chmod 400 /tmp/testfile
     
     <b>host$</b> ls -l /tmp/testfile
     -r-------- 1 mark users 33 2009-06-30 06:06 /tmp/testfile
     
     <b>host$</b> /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -f /tmp/test.cf -I
     -&gt; Object /tmp/testfile had permission 400, changed it to 612
     
     <b>host$</b> ls -l /tmp/testfile
     -rw---x-w- 1 mark users 33 2009-06-30 06:06 /tmp/testfile
</pre>
   <p>Once again, remember the comment about locking and <code>ifelapsed</code>
from the previous example.

   <p>Notice that this promise does not have a class expression like
<code>cfengine_3::</code>. 
The default class <code>any::</code> applies if nothing is stated, which means
`anytime, anyplace, anywhere'.

<p>To change root password of a system, we need to edit a file. A file is

promises to make about its contents.  CFEngine has bundles of promises
that are specially for editing. Make a copy of a shadow file and copy
it to <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> so that you can play with it.
<pre class="verbatim">

<h3 class="section">4.4 The update bundle - provisioning</h3>

<p>The default CFEngine configuration contains a bundle of promises that
copies the CFEngine binaries into the cache directory and copies
the policy files from the server into the default location. This example
is for local copying from file to file on the filesystem. Later, when we
set up a server component, you will be able to copy from a remote host. 
This is a simple example of system provisioning, with automated update.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">update</span>
{
<span class="red">vars:
</span>
<span class="comment"># A standard location for the source point
</span>
"master_location"<span class="red"> string </span>=><span class="green"> "/var/cfengine/masterfiles";</span>

<span class="red">files:
</span>
"/var/cfengine/inputs"

<span class="red">  comment </span>=><span class="green"> "Update the policy files from the master",</span>
<span class="red">  perms </span>=><span class="blue"> u_m("600"),</span>
<span class="red">  copy_from </span>=> u_cp("$(master_location)","localhost"),
<span class="red">  depth_search </span>=><span class="blue"> u_recurse("inf");</span>
}

</pre>
These promises contain several attributes in their bodies that we have
not seen yet. The <code>copy_from</code> attribute tells CFEngine how to
source
(copy) a file from a master location. The <code>depth_search</code> tells it
to search recursively through the sub-directories and their files.

   <p>Try changing the source files and executing the agent.

   <p>Again there are library reusable templates:
<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body perms</span> <span class="blue">u_m(p)</span>
{
<span class="red">mode  </span>=><span class="green"> "$(p)";</span>
}

<span class="comment">#
</span>

<span class="red">body copy_from</span> <span class="blue">u_cp(from,server)</span>
{
<span class="red">servers     </span>=> { "$(server)", "failover.example.org" };
<span class="red">source      </span>=><span class="green"> "$(from)";</span>
<span class="red">compare     </span>=><span class="green"> "digest";</span>
}

<span class="comment">#
</span>

<span class="red">body depth_search</span> <span class="blue">u_recurse(d)</span>

<span class="red">depth </span>=><span class="green"> "$(d)";</span>
<span class="red">exclude_dirs </span>=> { "\.X11", ".*kde.*", "logs", "log" };
}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">Here is an exercise: try using the reference manual to look up
the elements in this example. See if you can understand all the parts.

</div>

<h3 class="section">4.5 Reporting</h3>

<p>CFEngine contains a report generator called <samp><span class="file">cf-report</span></samp>. It is
configured
using control parameters described in the next chapter. Try:

<pre class="verbatim">host$ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-reports
host$ ls ~/.cfagent/reports
host$ mywebbrowser ~/.cfagent/reports/performance.html
</pre>

   <p>Most of these reports will be blank at the start, until you have run
CFEngine
on some significant promises.

<div class="node">
<a name="cf-execd"></a>
<a name="cf_002dexecd"></a>
<p><hr>
Previous:&nbsp;<a rel="previous" accesskey="p" href="#Reporting">Reporting</a>,
Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#First-promises">First promises</a>

</div>

<h3 class="section">4.6 <code>cf-execd</code></h3>

<p>CFEngine contains a service for running the agent with its default
configuration in <samp><span class="file">WORKDIR/inputs/promises.cf</span></samp> called the
exec-daemon. If you execute the binary directly it will go into the
background and execute <samp><span class="file">cf-agent</span></samp> every five minutes by default,
with its default policy.

   <p>You can try running it in the foreground:

<pre class="verbatim">host$ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-execd -F
</pre>

   <p>When you run CFEngine like this, any output that comes from CFEngine
is collected
and placed in <samp><span class="file">WORKDIR/outputs</span></samp>. If you have configured an email
address and
your host is running an SMTP service, then it will be sent as email. 
To configure
this you would add a control body to the <samp><span class="file">promises.cf</span></samp> file

<pre class="verbatim">body executor control

{
<span class="red">splaytime </span>=><span class="green"> "1";</span>
<span class="red">mailto </span>=><span class="green"> "cfengine_mail@example.org";</span>
<span class="red">smtpserver </span>=><span class="green"> "localhost";</span>
<span class="red">mailmaxlines </span>=><span class="green"> "30";</span>
}

</pre>
These other lines change different aspects of the hard-wired behavior
of the
executor, e.g. a load-balancing time delay before execution of the
agent, a mail address,
the name or IP address of an SMTP (mail) service, and the maximum
number of lines
of output to be included in any email sent.

   <p>You should start to see a pattern in the way CFEngine is configured. 
In the next
chapter, we'll look at these general matters.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Rules are promises</h3>

<p>Everything in CFEngine 3 can be interpreted as a promise. Promises can
be made about all kinds of different subjects, from file attributes,
to the execution of commands, to access control decisions and
knowledge relationships.

   <p>This simple but powerful idea allows a very practical uniformity in
CFEngine syntax.  There is only one grammatical form for statements in
the language that you need to know and it looks generically like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     type:
     
     classes::
     
       "promiser" -&gt; { "promisee1", "promisee2", ... }
     
          attribute_1 =&gt; value_1,
          attribute_2 =&gt; value_2,
          ...
          attribute_n =&gt; value_n;
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We speak of a promiser (the abstract object making the promise), the
promisee is the abstract object to whom the promise is made, and then
there is a list of associations that we call the `body' of the
promise, which together with the promiser-type tells us what it is all
about.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The promiser is always the object
affected by the promise. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>Not all of these elements are necessary every time. Some promises
contain a lot of implicit behavior. In other cases we might want to
be much more explicit.  For example, the simplest reports promise
looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     reports:
     
     "hello world";
     
</pre>
   <p>And the simplest commands promise looks like this

<pre class="smallexample">     
     commands:
     
     "/bin/echo hello world";
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This promise has default attributes for everything except the
`promiser', i.e. the
command string that promises to execute. 
A more complex promise contains many attributes:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     # Promise type
     files:
     
     # promiser                  -&gt; promisee (no curly braces needed if only one)
     "/home/mark/tmp/test_plain" -&gt; "system blue team",
     
      # attribute =&gt; value
          comment =&gt; "This comment follows the rule for knowledge  integration",
          perms   =&gt; owner("@(usernames)"),
          create  =&gt; "true";
     
</pre>
   <p>The list of promisees is not used by CFEngine except for
documentation, just
as the comment attribute (which can be added to any promise) has no
actual function
other than to provide more information to the user in error tracing
and auditing.

   <p>You see several kinds of object in this example. All literal strings
(e.g. <code>"true"</code>) in CFEngine 3 must be quoted. This provides
absolute consistency and makes type-checking easy and error-correction
powerful. All function-like objects (e.g. <code>users("..")</code>) are
either built-in
special functions or parameterized templates which contain the `meat'
of the right hand
side.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Control promises</h3>

<p>Certain promises that CFEngine components make are hard-wired into their
code. For example, the promise to email output to an appropriate
address, or the promise to wait until a certain time has elapsed before
checking a promise again (<code>ifelapsed</code>). Although these promises are
hard-wired, their behavior can be changed. In CFEngine, behavior is
always
constrained by the promise body. Thus hard-wired behavior is altered by
changing the control body for each. You can find these alterable
parameters
in the reference manual.

   <p>The most important bundle is the <code>common</code> bundle, that is read by
all components of CFEngine. It contains the list of promise bundles
that should be read in and examined for promise suggestions.  From the
<samp><span class="file">promises.cf</span></samp> file:

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body common control
</span>{
<span class="red">bundlesequence  </span>=> {
                 "update",
                 "garbage_collection",
                 "main",
                 "cfengine"
                 };

<h3 class="section">5.3 Variables</h3>

<p>Variables (or "variable definitions") are also promises &ndash; the promise to
represent their values.  We can write these in
any promise bundle. CFEngine recognizes two object types: scalars and
lists (lists contain 0 or more objects), as well as
three data-types (string, integer and real). Typing in CFEngine is
dynamic, as in
Perl and other scripting languages. Thus variables of any data-type
may be used as strings.

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Scalar variables</h4>

<p>Scalar variables hold a single value. The are declared as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     bundle <i>&lt;type&gt;</i> name
     {
     vars:
     
     "my_scalar" string =&gt; "String contents...";
         "my_int" int    =&gt; "1234";
        "my_real" real   =&gt; "567.89";
     
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><i>&lt;type&gt;</i></samp>&rsquo; indicates that any kind of bundle applies here. 
Scalar variables are referenced by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(name)</span></samp>&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">${name}</span></samp>&rsquo;) and they represent
a single value at a time.

     <ul>
<li>Scalars that are written without a context, e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(myvar)</span></samp>&rsquo;
are local to the current bundle.

     <li>Scalars are globally available everywhere provided one
uses the context to verify them e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(context.myvar)</span></samp>&rsquo;
may be written to access the variable `myvar' in bundle `context'.

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.2 List variables</h4>

<p>List variables hold several values. The are declared as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     bundle <i>&lt;type&gt;</i> name
     {
     vars:
     
        "my_slist" slist =&gt; { "list", "of", "strings" };
        "my_ilist" ilist =&gt; { "1234", "5678" };
        "my_rlist" rlist =&gt; { "567.89" };
     
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>An entire list is referred to with the at symbol &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;, but it does
not usually make sense to use this reference in a string. For instance
<pre class="smallexample">     
     reports:
     
       cfengine_3::
     
          "My list is @(my_slist)";
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">means nothing and cannot be expanded (it does not generate an
error, but instead inserts the text @(my_slist) into the string); but if
we use the scalar reference to a list variable, CFEngine will iterate over
the  values in
the list essentially making this into a list of promises.

<p class="noindent">To summarize:
     <ul>
<li>Scalar references to <i>local</i> list variables imply iteration,
e.g. 
suppose we have local list variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@(list)</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the
scalar &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(list)</span></samp>&rsquo; implies an iteration over every value of the
list.

     <li>Lists can be passed in their entirety in any context
where a list is expected as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@(list)</span></samp>&rsquo;., e.g.

     <pre class="verbatim">     
<span class="red">     vars:
</span>     
     "longlist"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { @(shortlist), "plus", "plus" };
     
     "shortlist"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { "you", "me" };
     
</pre>

     <p>The declaration order does not matter &ndash; CFEngine will execute the promise
to assign the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@(shortlist)</span></samp>&rsquo; before the promise to assign the
variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@(longlist)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Only local lists can be expanded directly. Thus &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(list)</span></samp>&rsquo;
can be expanded but not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(context.list)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Global
list references have to be mapped into a local context if you want to
use them for iteration. See the reference manual for more information.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Decisions</h3>

<p>CFEngine decisions are made behind the scenes and the results of
certain true/false propositions are cached in Booleans referred to as
`classes'. There are no if-then-else statements in CFEngine; all
decisions are made with classes.

   <p>CFEngine runs on every computer individually and each time it wakes up
the underlying generic agent platform discovers and classifies
properties of the environment or context in which it runs.  This
information
is effectively cached and may be used to make decisions about
configuration.

   <p>Classes fall into hard (discovered) and soft (user-defined) types.  A
single hard class can be one of several things:

     <ul>
<li>The name of an operating system architecture e.g. 
<code>ultrix</code>, <code>sun4</code>, etc.

     <li>The unqualified name of a particular host. If your system
returns a fully
qualified domain name for your host, CFEngine truncates it at the
first dot. Note: <code>www.sales.company.com</code> and
<code>www.research.company.com</code> have the same unqualified name &ndash; <code>www</code>.

     <li>The name of a user-defined group of hosts.

     <li>A day of the week (in the form <code>Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, ..</code>).

     <li>An hour of the day, current time zone (in the form <code>Hr00,
Hr01 ... Hr23</code>).

     <li>An hour of the day GMT (in the form <code>GMT_Hr00, GMT_Hr01 ... 
GMT_Hr23</code>). 
This is consistent the world over, in case you need virtual
simultaneity of change
coordination.

     <li>Minutes in the hour (in the form <code>Min00, Min17 ... Min45</code>).

     <li>A five minute interval in the hour (in the form <code>Min00_05,
Min05_10 ... Min55_00</code>)

     <li>The quarter-hour (in the form <code>Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4</code>).

     <li>A day of the month (in the form <code>Day1, Day2, ... Day31</code>).

     <li>A month (in the form <code>January, February, ... December</code>).

     <li>A year (in the form <code>Yr1997, Yr2004</code>).

     <li>A shift in <code>Night,Morning,Afternoon,Evening</code>, which fall
into six hour blocks
starting at 00:00 hours.

     <li>A `lifecycle index', which is the year number modulo 3 (used in
long term resource memory).

     <li>An arbitrary user-defined string.

     <li>The IP address octets of any active interface (in the form
<code>ipv4_192_0_0_1<!-- /@w --></code>,
<code>ipv4_192_0_0<!-- /@w --></code>, <code>ipv4_192_0<!-- /@w --></code>, <code>ipv4_192<!-- /@w --></code>).

   </ul>

<!-- chew end Hard classes -->
   <p>To see all of the classes define on a particular host, run

<pre class="smallexample">     host# cf-promises -v
</pre>
   <p>as a privileged user. Note that some of the classes are set only
if a trusted link can be established with cfenvd, i.e. if both
are running with privilege, and the <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/state/env_data</span></samp>
file is secure. More information about classes can be found in
connection with
<code>allclasses</code>.

   <p>User-defined or soft classes are defined in bundles. Bundles of type
<code>common</code> yield classes that are global in scope, whereas in all
other bundle types classes are local.  Soft classes are evaluated when
the
bundle is evaluated. They can be based on test functions or simply from
other classes:

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">myclasses</span>
{
<span class="red">classes:
</span>
"solinus"<span class="red"> expression </span>=><span class="green"> "linux||solaris";</span>

<span class="comment"># List form useful for including functions
</span>

"alt_class"<span class="red"> or </span>=> { "linux", "solaris", fileexists("/etc/fstab") };

"oth_class"<span class="red"> and </span>=> { fileexists("/etc/shadow"), fileexists("/etc/ 
passwd") };

<span class="red">reports:
</span>
alt_class::

<span class="comment">   # This will only report "Boo!" on linux, solaris, or any system
</span>
<span class="comment">   # on which the file /etc/fstab exists
</span>
   "Boo!";
}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">Classes may be combined with the operators listed here in order
from highest to lowest precedence:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">()</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The parenthesis group operator. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The NOT operator. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The AND operator. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The AND operator (alternative). 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The OR operator. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The OR operator (alternative). 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">So the following expression would be only true on Mondays or Wednesdays
from 2:00pm to 2:59pm on Windows XP systems:

<pre class="example">     
     (Monday|Wednesday).Hr14.WinXP::
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Consider the following more advanced example.  Promises in bundles
of type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">common</span></samp>&rsquo; are global in scope &ndash; all other promises are local to
the scope of their bundle.

   <p>Here we see that class &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zero</span></samp>&rsquo; is global while classes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">one</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">two</span></samp>&rsquo; are local. 
The report `Success' result is therefore true because only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zero</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">two</span></samp>&rsquo; are in scope in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls_2</span></samp>&rsquo; bundle (and the class

<h3 class="section">5.5 Loops</h3>

<p>If you are looking for loops in CFEngine then we need to reprogram you
a little, as you are thinking like a programmer!  CFEngine is not a
programming language that is meant to give you low level control, but
rather a set of declarations that embody processes. It's the difference
between the gears on a bicycle and the automated transmission in a
transporter.

   <p>Loops are executed implicitly in CFEngine, but there is no visible
mechanism for it &ndash; because that would steal attention from the
intention of the promises. The way to express them is through lists.

   <p>Loops are really a way to iterate a variable over a list. Try the
following.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body common control
</span>
{
<span class="red">bundlesequence  </span>=> { "example" };
}

<span class="comment">###########################################################
</span>

<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">example</span>

{
<span class="red">vars:
</span>
<span class="comment"># This is a list
</span>

"component"<span class="red"> slist </span>=> { "cf-monitord", "cf-serverd", "cf-execd" };

<span class="comment"># This is an associative array
</span>

"array[cf-monitord]"<span class="red"> string </span>=><span class="green"> "The monitor";</span>
"array[cf-serverd]"<span class="red"> string </span>=><span class="green"> "The server";</span>
"array[cf-execd]"<span class="red"> string </span>=><span class="green"> "The executor, not executionist";</span>

<span class="red">reports:
</span>
cfengine_3::

"$(component) is $(array[$(component)])";

}

</pre>
The output looks something like this:
<pre class="smallexample">     
     /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent -f ./unit_loops.cf -K
     
     R: cf-monitord is The monitor
     R: cf-serverd is The server
     R: cf-execd is The executor, not executionist
     
</pre>
   <p>You see from this that, if we refer to a list variable using the
scalar reference
operator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$()</span></samp>&rsquo;, CFEngine interprets this to mean &ldquo;please iterate
over all
values of the list&rdquo;. Thus, we have effectively a `foreach' loop, without the
attendant syntax.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Do I need cron?</h3>

<p>The Unix cron command is a useful beast, but a dumb one.  One of
CFEngine's strengths is its use of classes to identify systems from a
single file or set of files. Many administrators think that it would
be nice if the cron daemon also worked in this way. One possible way
of setting up cron from a global configuration would be to use the
CFEngine file editing capability to edit each cron file
separately. That would be missing an obvious opportunity however.

   <p>A much better way is to use CFEngine's time classes to work like a
user interface for cron.  This allows you to have a single, central
CFEngine file which contains all the cron jobs on your system without
losing any of the fine control which cron affords you. All of the
usual advantages apply:
     <ul>
<li>It is easier to keep track of what cron jobs are running on the
system when you have everything in one place.

     <li>You can use all of your carefully crafted groups and user-defined
classes to identify which host should run which programs. 
</ul>
   <a name="index-Cron-jobs_002c-controlling-with-CFEngine-1"></a>
The central idea behind this scheme is to set up a regular cron job on
every system which executes <code>cf-agent</code> at frequent intervals.  Each time
<code>cf-agent</code> is started, it evaluates time classes and executes the
shell commands defined in its configuration file.  In this way we use
<code>cf-agent</code> as a wrapper for the cron scripts, so that we can use
CFEngine's classes to control jobs for multiple hosts. CFEngine's time
classes are at least as powerful as <code>cron</code>'s time specification
possibilities, and they add control over location too.  This does not
restrict you in any way, See <a href="#Building-flexible-time-classes">Building flexible time classes</a>. The
only price is the overhead of parsing the CFEngine configuration file
which is insignificant.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
DO I NEED TO USE CRON? No. With CFEngine's <code>cf-execd</code> you don't
<i>have</i> to use cron &ndash; CFEngine can schedule itself. Whether you
choose to run <code>cf-execd</code> in daemon mode, or in wrapper mode is
entirely up to you. In the commercial versions of CFEngine, the exec
daemon has sophisticated features for reliability. In the Community
Edition, you might feel comfortable having something independent
watching over CFEngine, especially during binary updates during which
live programs can die from faults.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Structuring commands promises</h3>

<p>The structure of a promise bundle needs to reflect your policy for
running jobs on the system. You need to switch on relevant tasks and
switch off unwanted tasks depending on the time of day. This can be
done by placing individual actions under classes which restrict the
times at
which they are executed,

<h3 class="section">6.4 Splaying host times</h3>

<p>In a network of thousands of computers, many agents could start
executing and downloading resources from a server at the same time. 
For instance, if a thousand cf-agents all suddenly wanted to copy a
file from a master source simultaneously this would lead to a big load
on the server. We can prevent this from happening by introducing a
time delay which is unique for each host and not longer than some
given interval;  <code>cf-execd</code> uses a hashing algorithm to generate
a number
between zero and a maximum value in minutes which you define, like
this:

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body executor</span> <span class="blue">control</span>

{
<span class="red">splaytime </span>=><span class="green"> "10"; # Minutes</span>
}

</pre>

<p class="noindent">If this number is non-zero, <code>cf-execd</code> goes to sleep after
parsing its configuration file and reading the clock. Every machine's
<code>cf-execd</code> will go to sleep for a different length of time, which
is no longer than the time specified.

   <p>A hashing algorithm, based on the fully qualified name of the host, is
used to compute a unique time for hosts. The shorter the interval, the
more clustered the hosts will be. The longer the interval, the lighter
the load on your servers.  This `splaying' of the run times will
lighten the load on servers, even if they come from domains not under
your control but have a similar cron policy.

<h3 class="section">6.5 Building flexible time classes</h3>

<p>Each time CFEngine is run, it reads the system clock and defines
classes based on the time and date (see reference manual).

   <p>Time classes based on the precise minute at which cfagent started are
unlikely to be directly useful in policy (except in the
<code>cf-execd</code> schedule). Many things could conspire to delay the
precise time
at which cfagent were started. The real purpose in being able to
detect the precise start time is to define composite classes which
refer to arbitrary intervals of time. To do this, we use the
<code>group</code> or <code>classes</code> action to create an alias for a group
of time values. 
<a name="index-Grouping-time-values-2"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bgroups_007d-and-time-intervals-3"></a>Here are some creative examples:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     classes:  # synonym groups:
     
     "LunchAndTeaBreaks" expression =&gt; "!(Saturday|Sunday).(Hr12|Hr10|Hr15)";
     
     "NightShift"        or =&gt; { "Hr22", "Hr23", "Night" };
     
     "ConferenceDays"    or =&gt; { "Day26", "Day27", "Day29", "Day30" };
     
     "TimeSlices"        or =&gt; { "Min01", "Min02", "Min03", "Min10_15"
                                 "Min33", "Min34", "Min35" };
     
     "Exception"         not =&gt; "Hr12.Min15_20";
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the first three examples, the left hand sides of the assignments are
effectively the ORed result of the right hand side. Thus if any
classes in the braces is defined, the left hand side class
will become defined. This provides a flexible and readable way of
specifying intervals of time within a program, without having to
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; operators everywhere.

<p>How often should you call your global CFEngine configuration? There
are several
things to think about:

     <ul>
<li>How much fine control do you need? Running cron jobs once each hour is
usually enough for most tasks, but you might need to exercise finer
control for a few special tasks.

     <li>Are you going to verify the entire CFEngine configuration file
or just selected promises?

   </ul>

   <p>CFEngine has an intelligent locking and timeout policy which should be
sufficient to handle hanging shell commands from previous crons so that
no overlap can take place.

<h3 class="section">7.1 CFEngine network services</h3>

<p>By starting the daemon called <code>cf-serverd</code>, you can set up a line
of
communication between hosts, allowing them to exchange files across
the network or execute CFEngine remotely on another system. 
CFEngine network services are built around the following components:

     <dl>
<dt><code>cf-agent</code><dd>The configuration engine's only contact with the network is via
remote copy requests. It does not and cannot grant any access to a
system from the network. It is only able request access to files from
the
server component.

     <br><dt><code>cf-serverd</code><dd>A daemon which acts as both a file server and a remote-<code>cf-agent</code>
executor. This daemon authenticates requests from the network and
processes them according to rules specified in the server control body
and server bundles containing <code>access</code> promises.

     <br><dt><code>cf-runagent</code><dd>This is a simple initiation program which can be used
to run <code>cf-agent</code> on a number of remote hosts. It cannot
be used to tell <code>cf-agent</code> what to do, it can only ask <code>cf-
serverd</code>
on the remote host to run the <code>cf-agent</code> with its existing
configuration. 
Privileges can be granted to users to provide a kind of Role Based
Access Control (RBAC)
to certain parts of the existing policy.

   </dl>

<p class="noindent">With these components you have everything you need to do effective
distribution of resources (provisioning) of systems.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Remote file distribution</h4>

<p>This section describes how you can set up <code>cf-serverd</code> as a
remote file
server which can result in the distribution of files to client hosts in
a secure a reliable manner.

   <p>An important difference between CFEngine and other systems has to do
with the way files are distributed.  CFEngine uses a `pull' rather
than a `push' model for distributing network files.  A majority of
systems (probably) for instance, works by forcing an image of the
files on one server machine onto all clients. This happens in the manner
of an attack &ndash; indeed the recipients are often required to open various
ports and accept whatever they get. CFEngine will not support this kind
of technology as a matter of principle.

   <p>With the `push' approach files get changed when the distributor wishes
it and the clients have no choice but to live with the consequences. 
CFEngine, on the other hand, works by <i>voluntary cooperation</i>. Hosts
are allowed to remain in control of their defenses and protect
themselves against attacks and pushes if they want to.

   <p>In fact, CFEngine cannot (by design) force its will onto other hosts,
nor can it be forced. In order to distribute it can at best signal
all machines and ask them to collect files if they are willing. In other
words, CFEngine simulates a `push' model by polling each client and
running the local CFEngine configuration script giving the host the
chance to `pull' any updated files from the remote server, but leaving
it up to the client machine to decide whether or not it wants to
update.

   <p>Also, in contrast to programs like <code>rdist</code> which distribute files
over many hosts, CFEngine does not require any general <code>root</code>
access to a system using the <samp><span class="file">.rhosts</span></samp> file or the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/hosts.equiv</span></samp> file. It is sufficient to run the daemon as
root.  You can not run it by adding it to the <samp><span class="file">/etc/inetd.conf</span></samp>
file on your system however. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002fetc_002finetd_002econf_007d-file-and-CFEngine-4"></a>The restricted functionality of the daemon protects your system from
attempts to execute general commands as the root user using <code>rsh</code>.

   <p>To remotely access files on a server you use a <code>copy_from</code>
attribute
in a <samp><span class="file">files</span></samp> promise:

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent example
{
<span class="red">files:
</span>
"/var/cfengine/inputs"

<span class="red">  perms </span>=><span class="blue"> m("600"),</span>
<span class="red">  copy_from </span>=> remote_cp("$(master_location)","localhost"),
<span class="red">  depth_search </span>=><span class="blue"> recurse("inf"),</span>
<span class="red">  action </span>=><span class="blue"> immediate;</span>

}

<span class="comment"># Library template
</span>

<span class="red">body copy_from</span> <span class="blue">remote_cp(from,server)</span>
{
<span class="red">servers     </span>=> { "$(server)" };
<span class="red">source      </span>=><span class="green"> "$(from)";</span>
<span class="red">compare     </span>=><span class="green"> "mtime";</span>
}

</pre>
Assuming that the <code>cf-serverd</code> daemon is running on <var>server-
host</var>, <code>cf-agent</code>
will make contact with the daemon and attempt to obtain information
about the file. During this process, CFEngine verifies that the system
clocks of the two hosts are reasonably synchronized. If they are not,
it will not permit remote copying unless <code>denybadclocks</code> is false
in the server control body.

   <p>If <code>cf-agent</code> determines that a file needs to be updated from a
remote
server it begins copying the remote file to a new file on the same
filesystem as the destination-file. This file has the suffix
<samp><span class="file">.cfnew</span></samp>.

   <p>Only when the file has been successfully collected will <code>cf-
agent</code> make a
copy of the old file, (see <code>repository</code> in the Reference manual),
and rename the new file into place. This behavior is designed to avoid
race-conditions which can occur during network connections and indeed
any operations which take some time. If files were simply copied
directly to their new destinations it is conceivable that a network
error could interrupt the transfer leaving a corrupted file in place. 
<code>cf-agent</code> places a timeout of a few seconds on network
connections to
avoid hanging processes.

   <p>Normally the daemon sleeps, waiting for connections from the network. 
Such a connection may be initiated by a request for remote files from a
running <code>cf-agent</code> program on another host, or it might be
initiated by
the program <code>cf-runagent</code> which simply asks the
host running the daemon to run <code>cf-agent</code> or <code>cf-execd</code>
program locally.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.2 Remote execution of <code>cf-agent</code></h4>

<p>Occasionally you will want to run <code>cf-agent</code> immediately in order
to implement a change in configuration as quickly as possible on one
or more hosts. It would then be inconvenient to have to log onto every
host in order to do this manually.

   <p>If your scheduling interval is often enough, this should be
unnecessary since CFEngine will already have run by the time you
manage to log on &ndash; and the parallelism means that an entire network
can be altered in minutes without the delay of waiting for centralized
control.

   <p>But you might want to send a special signal, e.g. run policy with a
special class activated on just a few machines. Then a better way is
to issue a simple command which contacts the remote host and runs
<code>cf-agent</code> with role based access control, providing the
immediate output on your own screen:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     host$ cf-runagent -H <var>remote-host</var> -v
     
     <var>output....</var>
     
</pre>
     <ul>
<li>You avoid having to log in on a remote host in order to reconfigure
it.

     <li>Users other than root can run <code>cf-agent</code> to fix any problems with
the system, with access granted to individuals and classes.

   </ul>

   <p>A potential disadvantage with any such system is that malicious users
might be able to run <code>cf-agent</code> on remote hosts. The fact that
non-root users can execute <code>cf-agent</code> is not a problem in itself,
after all the most malicious thing they would be able to do would be
to check the system configuration and repair any problems.  No one can
tell <code>cf-agent</code> what to do using the <code>cf-runagent</code> program, it is only
possible to run an existing configuration.  But a more serious concern
is that malicious users might try to run <code>cf-agent</code> repeatedly
(so-called `Denial of Service' attack) so that a system became
burdened with running <code>cf-agent</code> constantly. 
To protect against this, the server uses the same <code>ifelapsed</code> locks
to complement access controls.

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.1 Server connection</h4>

<p>In order to connect to the CFEngine server you need
     <dl>
<dt><em>A public-private key pair.</em><dd>To create a key pair, run
     <pre class="smallexample">          cf-key
</pre>
     <br><dt><em>An IP (v4 or v6) address.</em><dd>You must be online with a configured network address. 
<br><dt><em>A client program</em><dd>Both <code>cf-agent</code> and <code>cf-runagent</code> are clients that can connect
to the server.

     <br><dt><em>Permission to connect to the server, and</em><dd>The server control body must grant access to your computer and public
key by name or IP address, by listing it in one of the lists (see
below).

     <br><dt><em>Your public key must be trusted by the server, and you must</em><dd>trust the server's public key

     <p>By mutually trusting each others' keys, client and server agree
to use that key as a sufficient identifier for the computer.

     <br><dt><em>Permission to access something</em><dd>
Your host name or IP address must be mentioned in an <code>access</code>
promise inside a server bundle, made by the file that you are
trying to access. 
</dl>

   <p>If all of the above criteria are met, connection will be established
and data will be transferred between client and server. The client can
only send short requests, following the CFEngine protocol. The server
can return data in a variety of forms, usually files, but sometimes
console output.

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.2 Remote access troubleshooting</h4>

<p>When setting up <code>cf-serverd</code>, you might see the error message

<pre class="verbatim">Unspecified server refusal
</pre>

   <p>This means that <code>cf-serverd</code> is unable or is unwilling to
authenticate the connection from your client machine. The message is
generic: it is deliberately non-specific so that anyone attempting to
attack or exploit the service will not be given information which
might be useful to them. There is a simple checklist for curing this
problem:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Make sure that the domain variable is set in the configuration files
read by both client
and server; alternatively use <code>skipidentify</code> and
<code>skipverify</code> to decouple DNS from the
the authentication.

     <li>Make sure that you have granted access to your client in the server body

     <pre class="smallexample">          
          body server control
          {
          allowconnects         =&gt; { "127.0.0.1" , "::1" <var>...etc</var> };
          allowallconnects      =&gt; { "127.0.0.1" , "::1" <var>...etc</var> };
          trustkeysfrom         =&gt; { "127.0.0.1" , "::1" <var>...etc</var> };
          }
          
</pre>
     <li>Make sure you have created valid keys for the hosts using <code>cf-key</code>. 
<li>If you are using secure copy, make sure that you have created a key
file and that you have distributed and installed it to all
participating hosts in your cluster.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">Always remember that you can run CFEngine in verbose or
debugging modes to see how the authentication takes place:

<pre class="verbatim">cf-agent -v
cf-serverd -v
</pre>

   <p><code>cf-agent</code> reports that access is denied regardless of the nature
of the error, to avoid giving away information which might be used by
an attacker. To find out the real reason for a denial, use verbose
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-v</span></samp>&rsquo; or
even debugging mode &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-d2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.3 Key exchange</h4>

<p>The key exchange model used by CFEngine is based on that used by
OpenSSH. It is a peer to peer exchange model, not a central
certificate authority model. This means that there are no scalability
bottlenecks (at least by design, though you might introduce your own
if you go for an overly centralized architecture).

   <p>The problem of key distribution is the conundrum of every public key
infrastructure. Key exchange is handled automatically by CFEngine and
all you
need to do is to decide which keys to trust.

   <p>When public keys are offered to a server, they could be accepted
automatically on trust because no one is available to make a decision
about them. This would lead to a race to be the first to submit a key
claiming identity.

   <p>Even with DNS checks for correct name/IP address correlation (turned
off with <code>skipverify</code>), it might be possible to submit a false
key to a server.

   <p>The server <code>cf-serverd</code> blocks the acceptance of unknown keys by
default. In order to accept such a new key, the IP address of the
presumed client must be listed in the <code>trustkeysfrom</code> stanza. 
Once a key
has been accepted, it will never be replaced with a new key, thus no
more trust is offered or required.

   <p>Once you have arranged for the right to connect to the server, you
must decide which hosts will have access to which files. This is done
with <code>access</code> rules.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">bundle server</span> <span class="blue">access_rules()</span>

{
<span class="red">access:
</span>
"/path/file"

<span class="red">  admit   </span>=> { "127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.2", "127.0.0.3" },
<span class="red">  deny    </span>=> { "192.*" };
}

</pre>

   <p>On the client side, i.e. <code>cf-runagent</code> and <code>cf-agent</code>, there
are three issues:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Choosing which server to connect to. 
<li>Trusting the identity of any previously unknown servers, i.e. trusting
the server's public key to be its and no one else's. (The issues here
are
the same as for the server.) 
<li>Choosing whether data transfers should be encrypted (with
<code>encrypt</code>).
        </ol>

   <p>Because there are two clients for connecting to <code>cf-serverd</code>
(<code>cf-agent</code> and <code>cf-runagent</code>), there are also two ways on
managing trust of server keys by a client. One is an automated option,
setting the option
<code>trustkey</code> in a <code>copy_from</code> stanza, e.g.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body copy_from</span> <span class="blue">example</span>
   {
<span class="comment">   # .. other settings ..
</span>
<span class="red">   trustkey </span>=><span class="green"> "true";</span>
   }

</pre>

   <p>Another way is to run <code>cf-runagent</code> in interactive mode. When you
run <code>cf-runagent</code>, unknown
server keys are offered to you interactively (as with <code>ssh</code>) for
you to
accept or deny manually:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     WARNING - You do not have a public key from host ubik.iu.hio.no =
     128.39.74.25
             Do you want to accept one on trust? (yes/no)
     --&gt;

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.3.4 Time windows (races)</h4>

<p>Once public keys have been exchanged from client to server and from
server to client, the issue of trust is solved according to public key
authentication schemes. You only need to worry about trust when one side
of a connection has never seen the other side before.

   <p>Often you will have a central server and many client satellites. Then
the best way to transfer all the keys is to set the <code>trustkey</code>
flags on server and clients sides to coincide with a time at which you
know that <code>cf-agent</code> will be run, and when a spoofer is unlikely
to be able to interfere.

   <p>This is a once-only task, and the chance of an attacker being able to
spoof a key-transfer is small. It would require skill and
inside-information about the exchange procedure, which would tend to
imply that the trust model was already broken.

   <p>Another approach would be to run <code>cf-runagent</code> against all the
hosts
in the group from the central server and accept the keys one by one,
by hand, though there is little to be gained from this.

   <p>Trusting a host for key exchange is unavoidable. There is no clever
way to avoid it. Even transferring the files manually by diskette, and
examining every serial number of the computers you have, the host has
to trust the information you are giving it. It is all based on
assertion. You can make it almost impossible for keys to be faked
or attacked, but you cannot make it absolutely impossible. Security is
about managing reasonable levels of risk, not about magic.

   <p>All security is based on a moment of trust at some point in
time. Cryptographic key methods only remove the need for a repeat of
the trust decision. After the first exchange, trust is no longer needed,
because they keys allow identity to be actually verified.

   <p>Even if you leave the trust options switched on, you are not blindly
trusting the hosts you know about. The only potential insecurity lies
in any new keys that you have not thought about. If you use wildcards
or IP prefixes in the trust rules, then other hosts might be able to
spoof their way in on trust because you have left open a hole for them
to exploit. That is why it is recommended to return the system to the
default state of zero trust immediately after key transfer, by
commenting out the trust options.

   <p>It is possible, though somewhat laborious to transfer the keys out of
band, by copying <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub</span></samp> to
<code>/var/cfengine/ppkeys/user-aaa.bbb.ccc.mmm</code> (assuming IPv4) on
another host. e.g.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     localhost.pub -&gt; root-128.39.74.71.pub
     
</pre>
   <p>This would be a silly way to transfer keys between nearby hosts that you
control yourself, but if transferring to long distance, remote hosts
it might be an easier way to manage trust.

<p>CFEngine normally runs as user "root" (except on Windows which does
not normally have a root user), i.e. a privileged administrator. If
other users
are to be granted access to the system, they must also generate a key
and go through the same process. In addition, the users must be added
to the server configuration file.

transfer. It is assumed that users will use this judiciously. There is
nothing to be gained by encrypting the transfer of public files &ndash;
overt use of encryption just contributes to global warming, burning
unnecessary CPU cycles without offering any security.

   <p>The main role for encryption in configuration management is for
authentication. CFEngine always uses encrypted for authentication, so
none of the encryption settings affect the security of authentication.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Knowledge Management</h2>

<p>A unique aspect of CFEngine, that is fully developed in the commercial
editions of the software, its ability to enable integrated knowledge
management as part of an automation process, and to use its configuration
technology as a `semantic' documentation engine.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="topicmap.png" alt="topicmap.png"></div>

   <p>Knowledge management is the challenge of our times.  Organizations
frequently waste significant effort re-learning old lessons because they have
not been documented and entered into posterity.  Now you can alleviate
this problem with some simple rules of thumb and even build
sophisticated index-databases of documents.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Promises and Knowledge</h3>

<p>The learning curve for configuration management systems has been the
brunt of frequent criticism over the years. Users are expected to either
confront the informational complexity of systems at a detailed level, or
abandon the idea of fine control altogether.  This has led either to
information overload or over-simplification. The ability to cope with
information complexity is therefore fundamental to IT management

   <p>CFEngine introduced the <em>promise model</em> for configuration in
order to flatten out this learning curve. It can lead to
simplifications in use, because a lot of the thinking has been done
already and is encapsulated into the model. One of its special
properties is that it is both a model for system behavior and a model
for knowledge representation (this is what declarative languages seek
to be, of course). More specifically, it incorporated a subset of the
ISO standard for `Topic Maps', an open technology for semantic
indexing of information resources.  By bringing together these two
technologies (which are highly compatible), we end up with a seamless
front-end for sewing together and browsing system information.

   <p>Knowledge management is a field of research in its own right, and it
covers a multitude of issues both human and technological. Most would
agree that knowledge is composed of facts and relationships and that
there is a need both for clear definitions and semantic context to
interpret knowledge properly; but how do we attach <em>meaning</em> to
raw information without ambiguity?

   <p>Knowledge has quite a lot in common with configuration: what after all
is
knowledge but a configuration of ideas in our minds, or on some
representation medium (paper, silicon etc). It is a coded pattern,
preferably one that we can agree on and share with others.  Both
knowledge and configuration management are about describing patterns. 
A simple knowledge model can be used to represent a policy or
configuration; conversely, a simple model of policy configuration can
manufacture a knowledge structure just as it might manufacture
a filesystem or a set of services.

<h3 class="section">8.2 The basics of knowledge</h3>

<p>Knowledge only truly begins when we write things down:

     <ul>
<li>The act of formulating something in writing brings a discipline
of thought than often lends clarity to an idea. 
<li>You never confront an idea fully until you try to put it into
language. 
<li>Any written record that is kept allows others to read it and
pass on the knowledge. 
</ul>

   <p>The trouble is that writing is something people don't like to do, and
few are very good at.  To an engineer, it can feel like a waste of
time, especially during a busy day, to break off from the doing to
write about the doing. Also, writing requires a spurt of creative
thinking and engineers are often more comfortable with manipulating
technical patterns and notations than writing fluent linguistic
formulations that seem overtly long-winded.

   <p>CFEngine tries to bridge this gap by making documentation simple and
part of the technical configuration. CFEngine's knowledge agent then
uses AI and network science algorithms to construct a readable
documentation from these technical annotations. It can do this because
a lot of thought has already gone into the meaning of the promise
model.

<h3 class="section">8.3 Annotating promises</h3>

<p>The beginning of knowledge is to annotate the technical specifications. 
Remember that the point of a promise is to convey an <i>intention</i>. 
When writing promises, get into the habit of giving every promise a
comment that explains its intention.  Also, expect to give special
promises
<i>handles</i>, or helpful labels that can be used to refer to them by in
other
promise statements. A handle could be something dumb like `xyz', but
you should
try to use more meaningful titles to help make references clear.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">files:
</span>
"/var/cfengine/inputs"

<span class="red">     handle </span>=><span class="green"> "update_policy",</span>
<span class="red">    comment </span>=><span class="green"> "Update the CFEngine input files from the policy server",</span>
<span class="red">      perms </span>=><span class="blue"> system("600"),</span>
<span class="red">  copy_from </span>=> rcp("$(master_location)","$(policy_server)"),
<span class="red">depth_search </span>=><span class="blue"> recurse("inf"),</span>
<span class="red">file_select </span>=><span class="blue"> input_files,</span>
<span class="red">     action </span>=><span class="blue"> immediate;</span>

</pre>
If a promise affects another promise in some way, you can
make the affected one
promise one of the promisees, like this:

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">access:
</span>
"/master/CFEngine/inputs" -> { "update_policy", "other_promisee" },

<span class="red">handle  </span>=><span class="green"> "serve_updates",</span>
<span class="red">  admit   </span>=> { "217.77.34.*" };

</pre>

<p class="noindent">Conversely, if a promise might depend on another in some
(even indirect) way, document this too.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">files:
</span>
"/var/cfengine/inputs"

<span class="red">      handle </span>=><span class="green"> "update_policy",</span>
<span class="red">     comment </span>=><span class="green"> "Update the CFEngine input files from the policy  </span>
server",
<span class="red">  depends_on </span>=> { "serve_updates" },
<span class="red">       perms </span>=><span class="blue"> system("600"),</span>
<span class="red">   copy_from </span>=> rcp("$(master_location)","$(policy_server)"),
<span class="red">depth_search </span>=><span class="blue"> recurse("inf"),</span>
<span class="red">file_select </span>=><span class="blue"> input_files,</span>
<span class="red">      action </span>=><span class="blue"> immediate;</span>

</pre>

<p class="noindent">This use of annotation is the first level of documentation
in CFEngine. 
The annotations are used internally by CFEngine to provide meaningful
error messages with context and to compute dependencies that reveal
the existence of process chains. These can be turned into a topic map
for browsing the policy relationships is a web browser, using
<code>cf-know</code>.

<h3 class="section">8.4 A promise model of topic maps</h3>

<p>CFEngine's model of promises can also be used to promise information
and its relevance in different contexts. The Knowledge agent <code>cf-know</code>
understands three kinds of promise.

     <dl>
<dt><code>topics:</code><dd>A topic is merely a string that can be associated with another string. It represents a `subject to be talked about'. 
Like other promise types, you can use contexts, which are formed from other topics expressions to limit the scope of
the current topic promise. 
<br><dt><code>things:</code><dd>Things are a simplified interface to topics, that were introduced to make it easier
for users to contribute knowledge about more concrete `things', or less abstract ideas. 
A challenge with knowledge management is the abstract and technical nature of the models
one must use to represent it. Things attempt to make that task easier. 
<br><dt><code>occurrences:</code><dd>An occurrence is a reference to a document or a piece of text that actually represents
knowledge content about the topic concerned. Occurrences are generally URLs or strings
explaining things or topics.

<h3 class="section">8.5 What topic maps offer</h3>

<p>CFEngine is capable of automating the documentation of a policy, using basic annotations provided above, as a
knowledge map. They require very little effort from the user. If you
are using the Community Edition of CFEngine, you can develop a topic
map, but we do not support the backend technology without a
commercial license. In either case, once you become familiar with the
use of Topic Maps, you will want to extend your knowledge manually to
incorporate things like:

     <ul>
<li>Local (high level) policy documents
<li>Related databases, such as CMDBs
</ul>

<p class="noindent">So let us spend a while showing how to encode knowledge in
topic maps
using <code>cf-know</code>.

   <p>The kind of result you can expect is shown in the pictures below.  The
example figures show typical pages generated by the knowledge agent
<code>cf-know</code>. The first of these shows how we use the technology to
power the web knowledge base in the commercial CFEngine product.

   <p>In this use, all of the data are based on documentation for
the CFEngine software, and most of the relationships are manually
entered.

   <p>For a second example, consider how CFEngine can generate such a
knowledge map analysis of its own configuration (self-analysis).  The
data in the images below describe the CFEngine configuration
promises. One such page is generated, for instance, for each policy
promise, and pages are generated for reports from different computers
etc. You can also create you own `topic pages' for any local
(enterprise) information that you have.

   <p>In this example, the promise has been given the promise-handle
<code>update_policy</code>, and the associations and the lower graph shows
how this promise relates to other promises through its documented
dependencies (these are documented from the promisees and
<code>depends_on</code> attributes of other promises.).

   <p>The example page shows two figures, one above the other. 
The upper figure shows the thirty nearest topics (of any kind) that
are related to this one. 
Here the relationships are unspecific. This diagram can reveal
pathways to related information
that are often unexpected, and illustrates relationships that broaden
one's understanding
of the place the current promise occupies within the whole.

   <p>Although the graphical illustrations are just renderings of
semantic associations shown more fully in text, they are useful for
visualizing
several levels of depth in the associative network. This can be
surprisingly useful for brainstorming and reasoning alike. In
particular, one can see the other promises that could be affected if
we were to make a change to the current promise.  Such impact analyses
can be crucial to planning change and release management of policy.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>

   <p>A knowledge base is a slightly improved implementation of a Topic Map which is an ISO
standard technology. A topic map works like an index that can point to
many different kinds of external resources, and may contain simple
text and images internally. So you use it to bind together documents
of any kind. A CFEngine knowledge base is not a new document format, it
is an overlay map that joins ideas and resources together, and
displays relationships.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">8.6.1 Topic map definitions</h4>

<p>Topic maps are really electronic indices, but they form and work like
webs. 
A topic is the technical representation of a `subject', i.e. anything
you might want
to discuss, abstract or physical e.g.  an item of `abstract
knowledge', which probably has a number of concrete exemplars. It
might be a person, a machine, a quality, etc.

   <p>Topics can be classified into boxes called <em>topic-types</em> so that
related
things can be collated and unrelated things can be separated, e.g. 
types allow us to distinguish between <code>rmdir</code> the Unix utility
and <code>rmdir</code> the Unix system-call.

   <p>Each typed topic can further point to a number of references or
exemplars called <em>occurrences</em>. For instance, an occurrence of
the topic `computer' might include books, web documents, database
entries, physical manifestations, or any other information.  An
occurrence is a reference that exemplifies the abstract
topic. Occurrence references are like the page numbers in an
index.

   <p>A book index typically has `see also' references which point from one
topic to another. 
Topic Maps allow one to define any kind of <em>association</em> between
topics. Unlike an ordinary index, a topic map has a rich (potentially
infinite) variety of cross reference types. 
For instance,
<pre class="smallexample">     topic_1 ``is a kind of'' topic_2
     topic_1 ``is improved by'' topic 2
     topic_1 ``solves the problem of'' topic_2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The topic map model thus has three levels of containers:

     <dl>
<dt><em>Contexts</em><dd>The box into which we classify a topic to disambiguate different
topics with the same name (`in the context of')<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

     <br><dt><em>Topics/Things</em><dd>The representation of a subject (an index term).

     <br><dt><em>Occurrence Types</em><dd>A term that explains how an actual document occurrence relates
to the topic is claims to say something about. e.g. (tutorial, manual,
or
example, definition, photo-album etc).

     <br><dt><em>Occurrences</em><dd>Specific information resources: these are pointers to the actual
documents
that we want to read  (like page numbers in an index). 
</dl>

   <p>Contexts map conveniently into CFEngine classes. 
Topics map conveniently into promisers. 
Occurrences also map to promisers of a different type. 
These three label different levels of granularity of meaning. Contexts
represent a set of topics that might be relevant, which in turn encompass a set of
occurrences of resources that contain actual information about the topics in that context. The primacy of topics in this
stems from their ability to form networks by <em>association</em>.

   <p>The classic approach to information modeling is to build a
hierarchical decomposition of non-overlapping objects. Data are
manipulated into non-overlapping containers which often prove
to be overly restrictive. Topic maps allow us to avoid the kinds of
mistakes that have led to monstrosities like the Common Information
Model (CIM) with its <em>thousands</em> of strictly non-overlapping type
categories.

   <p>Each topic allows us to effectively `shine a light' onto the
occurrences of information that highlight the concepts pertinent to
the topic somehow.

<h3 class="section">8.7 Example of topics promises</h3>

<p>You can use <code>cf-know</code> to render a topic map either as text (for
command line
use) or as HTML (for web rendering). We begin with the text rendering
as it requires less
infrastructure. You will just need a database.

<h4 class="subsection">8.7.1 Analyzing and indexing the policy</h4>

<p>CFEngine can analyze the promises you have made, index and cross
reference them using the command:

<pre class="verbatim"># cf-promises -r
</pre>
Normally, the default policy in Nova or Constellation will perform this
command each time the policy is changed.

<h4 class="subsection">8.7.2 <code>cf-know</code></h4>

<p>CFEngine's knowledge agent <code>cf-know</code> allows you to make promises
about knowledge and its inter-relationships. It is not specifically a
generic topic map language: rather it provides a powerful configuration
language for managing a knowledge base that can be compiled into a
topic map.

   <p>To build a topic map from a set of knowledge promises in <samp><span class="file">knowledge.cf</span></samp>, you would write:

<pre class="verbatim"># cf-know -b -f ./knowledge.cf
</pre>

   <p>The syntax of this file is hinted at below. 
The full ISO standard topic map model is too rich to be a useful tool
for system knowledge management. However, this is where powerful
configuration management can help to simplify the process: encoding a
topic map is a complex problem in configuration, which is exactly what
CFEngine is for. CFEngine's topic map promises have the following
form:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     bundle knowledge example
     {
     topics:
     
     topic_type_context::                          # canonical container
     
     "Topic name"                                # short topic name
     
           comment =&gt; "Use this for a longer description",
       association =&gt; a("forward assoc to","Other topic","backward assoc");
     
       "Other topic";
     
     occurrences:
     
     Topic_name::                                   # Topic
     
       "http://www.example.org/document.xyz"        # URI to instance
     
         represents =&gt; { "Definition", "Tutorial"}; # sub-types
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>The association body templates look like this:
<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">body association</span> <span class="blue">a(f,name,b)</span>
{
<span class="red">forward_relationship </span>=><span class="green"> "$(f)";</span>
<span class="red">backward_relationship </span>=><span class="green"> "$(b)";</span>
<span class="red">associates </span>=> { $(name) };
}

</pre>

   <p>Promise theory adds a clear structure to the topic map ontology, which
is highly beneficial as experience shows that weak conceptual models
lead to poor knowledge maps.

<h3 class="section">8.8 Modeling configuration promises as topic maps</h3>

<p>We can model topic maps as promises within CFEngine; the
question then remains as to how to use topic maps to model
configurations so that CFEngine users can navigate the documented
promises using a web browser and be able to see all of the
relationships between otherwise isolated and fragmentary rules. This
will form the basis of a semantic Configuration Management Database
(sCMDB) for the CFEngine software. The key to making these ends meet
is to see the configuration of the topic map as a number Ã¶f promises
made in the abstract space of topics and the turning each promise into
a meta-promise that models the configuration as a topic with attendant
associations. Consider the following CFEngine promise.

<pre class="verbatim">
<span class="red">bundle agent</span> <span class="blue">update</span>
{
<span class="red">files:
</span>
any::

``/var/cfengine/inputs'' -> { ``policy_team'', ''dependent'' },

<span class="red">          comment </span>=><span class="blue"> ``Check policy updates from source'',</span>
<span class="red">            perms </span>=><span class="blue"> true,</span>
<span class="red">             mode </span>=><span class="blue"> 600,</span>
<span class="red">        copy_from </span>=><span class="blue"> true,</span>
<span class="red">      copy_source </span>=><span class="blue"> /policy/masterfiles,</span>
<span class="red">          compare </span>=><span class="blue"> digest,</span>
<span class="red">     depth_search </span>=><span class="blue"> true,</span>
<span class="red">            depth </span>=><span class="blue"> inf,</span>
<span class="red">         ifelapsed </span>=><span class="blue"> 1;</span>

}
</pre>

   <p>This system configuration promise can be mapped by CFEngine into a
number of other promise proposals intended for the <code>cf-know</code>
agent. Suppressing some of the details, we have:

<pre class="verbatim">
type_files::

"/var/cfengine/inputs"
<span class="red">    association </span>=><span class="blue"> a("promise made in bundle","update","bundle  </span>
contains promise");
"/var/cfengine/inputs"
<span class="red">    association </span>=><span class="blue"> a("specifies body type","perms","is specified in");</span>
"/var/cfengine/inputs"
<span class="red">    association </span>=><span class="blue"> a("specifies body type","mode","is specified in");</span>
"/var/cfengine/inputs"
<span class="red">    association </span>=><span class="blue"> a("specifies body type","copy_from","is specified  </span>
in");

<span class="comment"># etc ...
</span>

<span class="red">occurrences:
</span>
_var_CFEngine_inputs::

  "promise_output_common.html#promise__var_CFEngine_inputs_update_cf_13"
<span class="red">     represents </span>=> { "promise definition" };

</pre>
Note that in this mapping, the actual promise (viewed as a real world
entity) is an occurrence of the topic `promise'; at the same time each
promise could be discussed as a different topic allowing
meta-modeling of the entity-relation model in the real-world
data. Conversely the topics themselves become configuration items or
`promisers' in the promise model. The effect is to create a navigable
semantic web for traversing the policy; this documents the structure
and intention of the policy using a small ontology of standard
concepts and can be extended indefinitely by human domain experts.
