<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is knowledge management?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Everyone agrees that Knowledge Management is important, but
few really appreciate what it means to manage knowledge, or how to
begin.  Ironically perhaps, even learning institutions (so-called knowledge
based industries) like schools and universities often do not do a good
job of this.  Having a wealth of knowledge is not the same as knowing
how to foster and protect it.  Most organizations take their
knowledge for granted.

   <p>In the worst case, poorly run organizations end up as collections of
individuals, each of whom possesses knowledge and experience,
but none of whom knows anything about the others' roles.  This scenario presents a
high risk for the continuity of the organization, since taking out
even a single player could cripple a key work process.

   <p>The end result is that many organizations are caught in a poverty trap
of knowledge: they spend their time reacting to emergencies cultivated
by a lack of confidence and certainty, and they are too busy patching over holes that
they never have time to learn enough to escape the pattern.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Risk and uncertainty</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Knowledge exists to reduce our uncertainty about the world. We don't
generally learn in order to get smart, or to be experts; rather we
learn by necessity and feel smart when there are no remaining
surprises. Experts are people who can answer questions they already
know the answer to; they are supposedly extra-ordinary. Innovators are
people who can solve new problems &ndash; they are even rarer.

   <p>The main aim of knowledge management is not to make everyone an
expert, but to improve the predictability of workflow processes so
that we can respond to unpredictable changes in the environment with
greater confidence, without losing the feeling of control over
the situations we find ourselves in. 
To do that, we have to make the connections between the appropriate
parts to that we can always obtain the answers.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How should you begin?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
The road to maturity can be seen as stepping through one or more of
the following progressions:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Data \rightarrow Information \rightarrow Knowledge \rightarrow Wisdom    (DIKW)

     <li>Objectives \rightarrow Results

     <li>Intentions \rightarrow Promises \rightarrow Assessments
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<img src="dikw.png" alt="DIKW">

   <p>Each of these sequences represents an increasing level of commitment. 
You need to have data to interpret them as information. You need to
have goals or objectives in order to realize them and see results. You
need to have intentions to make promises, and so on.  Ask yourself:
does everyone in your team know your business goals, and how to
translate their efforts into progess?

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The CFEngine Knowledge map</h3>

<p>Maps guide us to where we need to get to from where we are (even when we don't
fully understand where we are). A map places us in the context or a larger
picture and helps us to find our way. 
The Knowledge map is a part of the CFEngine Mission Portal,
which in turn is provided with CFEngine Nova and Constellation Editions. 
Significant instrumentation of the software, user process and policy analysis
are provided in these editions in order to make Knowledge mining as transparent
to the user as possible.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Our first task in Knowledge Management is to create a map of the knowledge
landscape in which we work. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>CFEngine contains a tool <code>cf-know</code> for creating a map called a
Topic Map, that forms to basis of our approach to documentation. 
Further, CFEngine Enterprise Editions, starting with Nova help fill in
the landscape of this map automatically.

   <p>To build a map, you will need data (hence the beginning of the DIKW chain). 
To use a map, you need an objective or an intention, hence the others.

   <p>Ask yourself: what are the places in this map, and what are the paths between them? 
This is a question every organization needs to ask itself.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Pitfalls to avoid</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine does a lot of work for you, but you need to do something to help
yourself too. Your organization should create documents and references
to capture its internal knowledge. If you are doing this well, it should not be
a major task.

   <p>Knowledge gets out of control when you don't standardize ideas,
concepts and procedures. By standardizing topics and concepts, you
prevent an explosion of redundancy &ndash; only then can you see
the signal in the noise. Standardization minimizes the number of things
you have to deal with. Be careful though, if you go too far, standardization
can become a straightjacket, preventing you from clear and free expression. 
Too much standardization and you will be stuck in a rut.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Dedicate yourself to a culture of simplicity, but not of
over-simplification (which often backfires). Always work to avoid
special cases and exceptions, unless they can be rigorously justified. 
</td></tr></table>

   <p>This is a question of economics: is it worth the cost of maintaining a
special case? CFEngine's is designed to make it a lot easier and
cheaper to manage exceptions, so you needn't worry too much. Just
don't go mad.

   <p>Simplification is the hardest thing you will ever do. Anyone can make
something more complicated, but it takes real work to simplify
something<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Einstein's famous quote
captures this: <i>You should always make everything as simple as
possible, but no simpler.</i>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Types of information</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

There are many kinds of information that contribute to a strategy for
managing knowledge. The ability to learn from past mistakes demands
that we look both forwards and backwards, while realizing that
knowledge grows older and less useful the older it gets. 
For instance, what is known about the past? What
is current? How can we track these things?  Information comes in
logically different categories as well as different types.  Data have
different sources, and are about different epochs.  We need to unify
and integrate these in Knowledge Management.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Conceptual information (Always)</i><dd>
Conceptual information is knowledge of a general nature that defines
basic terms and concepts that describe the operational area of the
organization. e.g. background theory, compliance requirements, frameworks, license
expiry documents. Contracts and agreements.

     <p>This information comes from the wider culture of the enterprise. It is often
treated poorly as our modern culture has an unreasonable suspicion of anything that
seems `academic'.

     <br><dt><i>System observations (Past)</i><dd>
Recording what has actually happened in the organization. This includes
the IT system, but also the business services and workflows, e.g. 
changes, transactions, logs, incidents, events, performance values (Key
Performance Indicators), audits, security scans, etc. This includes
what it traditionally called system monitoring.

     <p>This comes from probing and monitoring human-computer processes.

     <br><dt><i>Enterprise process documentation (Now)</i><dd>
These documents are about business internals, recipes, manuals and
how-tos.  They allow individuals to work autonomously without constant
supervision, because they all have a copy of the script. This
information is about <i>orchestration</i> of parts. In an orchestra each
player can manage to play his or her part with only minimal advice
from a conductor because they each have a copy of their music. Their
music is their process documentation.

     <p>This is closely related to policy and comes from internal management bodies.

     <br><dt><i>Policy (Future)</i><dd>
Here are the promises and intentions of the IT mission.  Documents of
all degrees of technicality form policy. They contain the decisions
you have made for steering the mission under all possible
contingencies.

     <p>Policy is informed by all of the above, and usually changes in
response to recurring `problems' identified in the observations. It
originates from internal management.

   </dl>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Creating your own map</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
CFEngine provides a lot of knowledge about your system out of the box, that includes a domain
model about the space of IT management, and an automated analysis of the deployed policy. 
Below are some notes about how this is built, and things you can do to improve the information
by adding knowledge that cannot be discovered automatically.
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>You begin by documenting your intentions by creating a CFEngine automation policy, i.e. bundles of promises.

     <li>You add comments, handles, promisees etc to your policy to full explain your intentions.

     <li>You can assign each host in your network to a special class that represents its
physical location, using <code>classes:</code> promises. You should then collect
such classes into a topic context called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">locations::</span></samp>&rsquo; in the <samp><span class="file">company_knowledge.cf</span></samp> file.

     <li>CFEngine runs <code>cf-promises -r</code> to build a decompsition of your
current policy.

     <li>CFEngine runs <code>cf-know -bf enterprise_build.cf</code> to build the knowledge map.

     <li>You may create enterprise process documents and written policies for your
organization, which you will link into the knowledge map.

     <li>CFEngine Nova creates the Knowledge Map which includes
a conceptual framework for IT management, and which integrates with
the CFEngine software documentation.

     <li>You may now extend the basic knowledge map with more of your
own special documentation by placing references and
additional concepts into the file <samp><span class="file">company_knowledge.cf</span></samp>, on the policy server.

        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Documenting goals</h3>

<p>Business goals are shown in the service catalogue in the Mission Portal of CFEngine Nova and Constellation
for each hub. To document the fact that a promise or bundle contributes to a business goal,
you must do two things:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Document the goal (see below under the example <samp><span class="file">company_knowledge.cf</span></samp> file). e.g. 
<pre class="verbatim">     topics:
     
       goals::
         "goal 1" comment => "Do good things";
         "goal 2" comment => "Be first";
         "goal 3" comment => "Be best";
     
</pre>
<li>Make the goal a promisee of the promise concerned.

     <pre class="verbatim">     methods:
     
        "security"  -> { goal_1, goal_2 }
      
                        comment => "Basic change management",
                      usebundle => change_management;
        "maintenance" 
                        comment => "Perform log rotation",
                      usebundle => garbage_collection;
</pre>

        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Documenting locations</h3>

<p>To document the location of a host, make sure that it is placed inside a class that represents its address:

<pre class="verbatim">classes:

  "london"     or => { "host1", "host2" };
  "alexandria" or => { "host3", "host4", "host5" };

</pre>
Then designate these classes as locations in the knowledge map:
<pre class="verbatim">topics:

 locations::

  "london"     comment => "29 Market Street, London XW4, third on the left";
  "alexandria" comment => "Secret chamber, discovered by Indiana Jones";

CFEngine cannot produce everything you need for your library of knowledge. 
There cannot be hard and fast rules about this. Here are some suggestions:

     <ul>
<li>A policy on human roles and responsibilities, to avoid gaps in and unecessary doubling of effort. 
<li>A risk/security policy. 
<li>A standardization and procedure manual. 
<li>Incident logs of matters not detected and repaired by CFEngine. 
<li>Repair logs of matters not  detected and repaired by CFEngine. 
<li>Requests for change (RFC) logs. 
<li>Promises in your organization that are not just for CFEngine to keep, documenting intentions. 
<li>A policy on Knowledge Retention and Business Continuity. 
</ul>

<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Hint: a simple way to have a log is to use a tickets system like OTRS or a moderated mailing list, and to email
new entries. Something like a Mailman archive allows then tracking and integration.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Knowledge transfer</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Passing on knowledge to others could be considered a `best
practice'.  Alas, this is not as easy as it sounds.  There are plenty
of strategies to achieve knowledge transfer:

     <ul>
<li>Reading
<li>Taking courses
<li>Research
<li>Repetition
<li>Job swapping and promotion
</ul>

<p class="noindent">These are just a few. However, this list is old news, and
these items alone will not lead to knowledge transfer.

   <p>One of the most important <i>barriers</i> to knowledge transfer is that
individuals refuse to learn new things. A lack of dynamism in a
company or organization establishes patterns of habit that are hard to
break. The longer they last, the more likely they are to continue.

   <p>Promise theory makes clear that, even if all staff promise
to write excellent documentation, they do not necessarily promise
to read each others' documents. Transfer requires a commitment both
to send and to receive.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
     <ul>
<li>The final step to managing knowledge is to foster a culture
of knowledge acquisition, retention and transfer.

     <li>Knowledge transfer requires a commitment by all parties
          <ul>
<li>to learn outside of their box.

          <li>to pass on their expertise to others. 
</ul>
     </ul>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p>Communication skills are clearly important, but this is a serious flaw
in the idea. Written communication skills are not as common as we
might think. This means it is hard for the writer, and also for the
reader.

   <p>The solution taken by CFEngine is to reduce the problem of
documentation to one of coding notes and relationships. This requires
only minor writing skills. The technology can then assemble these notes
using intelligent algorithms and present the result in an organized form
with visual aids. You should pay special attention to the syntax items:

<pre class="verbatim"> comment => 
 handle =>
 depends_on =>

 -> { promisees }

</pre>

   <p>You need to foster a culture of using information, in order for it
to become assimilated as knowledge. Unused information will perish.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How does CFEngine Nova help?</h3>

     <ul>
<li>CFEngine assists knowledge management by providing tools for integration
of knowledge sources.

     <li>A formal structure for encoding policy at relationships at a functional level

     <li>Technical syntax makes annotation easy for IT workers, and CFEngine can construct
the surrounding story using intelligent algorithms.
