<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What is a hierarchy?</h3>

<p>A hierarchy is an organizational structure with tree-like branches. In
a hierarchy, parts of the system belong to other parts, like
collections of boxes inside other boxes. Each time you move, you
either ascend or descend to a different level with respect to the
root. Hierarchies are called <i>Directed Acyclic Graphs</i> (DAG) in
mathematics (see figure below (a) and (b)).

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="networks.png" alt="Network organizational structures."></div>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Hierarchies are often associated with <i>authority</i>, as
we use hierarchies to organize human `chains of command'.  In this
case, a hierarchy typically has multiple levels, as in (b). You might
interpret this diagram as showing a single point of top level
management, then satellite areas of middle management each with their
own clusters of slaves (leaf nodes). When drawing hierarchies, the root of the tree is
placed at the top or centre of the picture and is considered to be
<i>authoritative</i>, i.e. more important than the `leaves'. Each leaf
node is then subject to the control of the root in a <i>top down</i>
manner.

   <p>The opposite of a hierarchy is a <code>mesh</code> or web (figure (c)),
which has no special or privileged node &ndash; nodes are simply connected
by some kind of relationship. In mesh organization, each individual
has an area of responsibility and they talk on demand to other nodes,
without any particular ranking.  If you move in a mesh, you cannot
easily measure how far you are away from a given point, as their might
be more than one way of getting there.

   <p>Mesh architectures are often robust to failure as there can be multiple
`peer to peer' routes for passing messages or information.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Top-down is is a cultural prejudice or `norm', as most human societies work in this
way.  However it is not a necessity. A network service is bottom-up &ndash; there
it is the leaves which drive requests that end at a single central server. 
Hierarchies are special cases of <i>networks</i>, and (as all special cases) they are fragile,
because the have top-down redundancy, but not bottom-up redundancy. 
We say that hierarchies have a Single Point of Faliure at the root,
as failure at that point will disconnect the network.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How hierarchy compares to sets</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Some languages (like Object Oriented languages) are designed to
enforce hierarchies. CFEngine is not one of these. In CFEngine you can
build a hierarchy if you want to, but you can also build any other
kind of network. The parts of your system can also work with complete
autonomy if that is what you want. CFEngine does not push a model onto you.

<p class="noindent">Consider this example of CFEngine classes. It expresses a tree
structure.
<pre class="verbatim">classes:

 # Conceptual hierarchy

 "top"      or => { "middle_1", "middle_2", "middle_3" }; 
 "middle_1" or => { "slave_1",  "slave_2",  "slave_3"  }; 
 "middle_2" or => { "slave_4",  "slave_5",  "slave_6"  }; 

</pre>
This example is contrived. The core classes that CFEngine cares about
are the slaves, since CFEngine is a bottom-up system. The definition
of the middle and top classes are <i>aggregations</i> of clusters of
basic member attributes.

   <p>Consider this example of a geographically distributed organization,
with finance, engineering and legal departments in three countries.
<pre class="verbatim"># Hierarchy

 "headquarters"  or => { "usa",      "uk",           "norway" }; 
 "department"    or => { "finance",  "engineering",  "legal"  }; 

</pre>
We can express the full hierarchy like this:
<pre class="verbatim">usa.finance
usa.engineering
usa.legal
uk.finance
uk.engineering
uk.legal
norway.finance
norway.engineering
norway.legal
</pre>
In this notation, the dot looks like `member' because the
departments are smaller than the countries and are contained within them. 
You might feel that this model is upside down and that one should consider
the finance department to be a unified global entity, with branches in
three different countries. In that case, you would write
<pre class="verbatim">finance.uk
finance.usa
finance.norway
</pre>

   <p>This highlights the fact that we often want to slice and dice organizations
in different ways, and attending too closely to a single hierarchical model
prevents that. 
The key is to notice that the `.' (dot) operator is really an intersection
of sets (AND)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and that this is
a much more flexible notion than hierarchy.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Classes are sets</h3>

<blockquote>
<i>`Sets, sets, sets ... all you ever think about it sets!'<br></i>
<br>
&ndash; Anonymous
</blockquote>

   <p>Underlying hierarchies and networks is the concept of <i>sets</i>.  A set
or <i>collection</i> of something is just a number of instances that
satisfy some property. For example, the <i>set of all Windows
machines</i>, or the <i>set of times between 2 and 3 o'clock</i>.  Sets can
be thought of as networks in which the elements are all joined to each
other by a common relationship `in the same set as'.

   <p>The name of a set can be thought of as a property that characterizes
the members, and as such it behaves like an abstract box or container for the members. 
Containment in classes is the basis for hierarchies in Object Orientation, for instance.

   <p>We often write subset membership using a membership `.' character, e.g. if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">linux</span></samp>&rsquo;
is the set of hosts with property `linux', then a subset (or sub-class) of these
hosts is `debian' (see figure). The class <i>64 bit hosts</i> is not a subset of
linux, as part of it lies outside. It is a subset of <i>hosts</i>.

<pre class="example">     linux.debian
     linux <i>AND</i> debian
     linux <i>intersect</i> debian
</pre>
   <div align="center"><img src="intersect.png" alt="Overlapping sets."></div>

   <p>Sets can be made hierarchical when every subset is contained entirely by one and
only one parent set, and in turn contains zero or more whole subsets which it
does not share with any other. The problem with hierarchical sets is
that they are too restrictive. If you design them incorrectly in the
first place, you shut parts of the organization inside a box that
prevents other parts from accessing them.

   <p>CFEngine works only with sets. It does not assume that sets never overlap. 
Indeed, it encourages you to use as many overlapping sets as possible to
create optimum, simple categories to address the parts of your organization. 
This gives us great power. We can for instance extract the list of all English
speaking entities from the definitions about our organization, by adding a
defintion of set <i>union</i> (OR or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;) and <i>intersection</i> (AND or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;):
<pre class="verbatim"># Hierarchy

 "headquarters"  or => { "usa",      "uk",           "norway" }; 
 "department"    or => { "finance",  "engineering",  "legal"  }; 

 "english_speaking" expression => "(usa|uk).!legal"; 

</pre>
Thus the English speakers are those entities belonging to
the USA `AND' the UK, excepting presumably the legal department.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">For and against hierarchies</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Hierarchies are good at bringing consistency. They are bad at scaling. 
They bring consistency because the root node acts as a single point of
authority, i.e. the network speaks with a single voice. The scale
poorly because they funnel communication to a single point of failure
and processing so that the weakest link is the most authoratative
node.

   <p>The Internet was designed by smart engineers to <i>not</i> be a hierarchy
so that it would be robust to failure of single nodes. Since then,
incorrigable humans have done their best to make it hierarchical from
the viewpoint of the Domain Name Service (DNS) classification, so that
organizational identifiers seem to fall into simple tree-like
hierarchies.

   <p>Because the idea of hierarchy is so prevalent, it is many peoples' first
instinct to build hierarchical organizations. At CFEngine we believe that
the idea is over-used, and causes as many problems as it brings solutions,
so CFEngine does not encourage it.

   <p>This document tries to show how to use hierarchy sensibly and usefully to
simplify rather than to enforce authority.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Inheritance and its forms</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>
Perhaps the most popular application of hierarchy is to use the
property of having a single-point of definition to avoid maintaining
the same information in more than one place. <i>This is an efficiency</i>. 
Inheritance is expressed in different ways:

     <ul>
<li>Special subset <i>extends</i> base set properties, emphasizing that the
leaf builds on, or adds the root in order to extend it. 
<li>Special subset <i>inherits</i> base set properties, emphasizing that
the leaf is a consumer of the root and does not necessarily offer any more. 
<li>Special subset <i>depends on</i>, emphasizing that the root is a single
point of failure for the leaf. 
</ul>
   These are basically equivalent expressions of the same thing.  No
matter how we choose to express this, inheritance is a client-server
relationship in which a single source is feeding a number of possible
users.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
In Promise Theory, we consider this to be a use-promise (service) relationship. 
A single point promises information, and a number of leaf-nodes promise to use it. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<div align="center"><img src="inherit.png" alt="Network organizational structures."></div>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>
The figure shows how we maintain common information in a `base' or server. 
Then the users or consumers of the information are so-called derived classes.

   <p>We can use the notion of inheritance at different levels within CFEngine. 
These are a matter of using the global scope with bundle names.

     <dl>
<dt><i>Inheritance of classes/sets</i><dd>We can aggregate smaller classes into larger ones (yielding multiple
inheritance of class attributes):
<pre class="verbatim">     classes:
     
       "group_name" or => { 
                          "base_class_1", 
                          "base_class_2", 
                          "base_class_3" 
                          };
     
</pre>
Note that CFEngine naturally forms a bottom-up hierarchy, never a top-down hierarchy.

     <br><dt><i>Inheritance of class definitions</i><dd>CFEngine divides its promises into bundles that have private classes
and variables. Bundles called `common bundles' define <i>global classes</i>,
so they are automatically inherited by all other bundles.

     <br><dt><i>Inheritance of variable definitions</i><dd>
Variables in CFEngine are globally accessible, but you must say
what bundle you are talking about by writing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(bundle.scalar)</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@(bundle.list)</span></samp>&rsquo;. If you omit the `bundle', it is assumed
that the variable is in the current bundle.

     <pre class="verbatim">     bundle agent child_bundle(parameter)
     {
     vars:
     
       "extend_list" slist => { "extension", @(foreign.list) },
                    policy => "ifdefined";
     
     reports:
     
       "Inherit parameter value $(parameter)";
       "Inherit foreign scalar value $(foreign.scalar)";
     
     }
</pre>
The policy <code>ifdefined</code> means that CFEngine will ignore
the foreign list if is does not exist. This means you can
include a number of lists from other bundles to extend
the behviour of your own, if they are provided.

     <br><dt><i>Inheritance of bundles</i><dd>Bundles cannot really be merged like sets, but since they
make promises you can <i>use</i> them.

     <pre class="verbatim">     bundle agent child_bundle
     {
     methods:
     
       "extend_method" use => base_bundle(parameter1,parameter2);
     
     }
</pre>

     <p>A bundle can only be used if it exists, so we can also talk about
plug-ins for bundles. In CFEngine, you include entire bundles either
in the the <code>bundlesequence</code>, or as <code>methods</code>.

     <p>Normally you have to know exactly which bundles are going to exist in
advance, as CFEngine considers missing code to be a security issue and
will signal an error for missing bundles. This is the default
behaviour, but we can override it using the following <code>body agent
control</code> promises.
          <dl>
<dt><code>ignore_missing_bundles</code><dd>Skip over any bundles listed in the <code>bundlesequence</code> constraint and continue
without error. 
<br><dt><code>ignore_missing_inputs</code><dd>Skip over any input files listed in the <code>inputs</code> contraint and continue
without error. 
</dl>

   </dl>

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Be aware of the security implications of inheritance. Because of the assumption of
authority, by promising to use the inheritance, you have subordinated your input

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Expressing `is a' or `has a'</h3>

<p>Let us re-emphasize for the record that CFEngine is not intended to be
an object oriented system. At CFEngine we do not believe that Object
Orientation is a good way to think about complex architectures.

   <p>That said, all object-oriented class relationships are expressable as
set relationships, as sets are the basis of all computing. We can therefore
understand relationships like `is a' and `has a' in CFEngine, even if they
are not the recommended way of thinking.

   <p>For example, if we say that <code>debian</code> `is a' (kind of)
<code>linux</code>, or conversely that <code>linux</code> `has a' (subtype called)
<code>debian</code>, then we are expression <i>container</i> promises. We mean
that <code>debian</code> is a subset of <code>linux</code>, and this means. In
concrete terms <code>debian</code> might or might not extend <code>linux</code>,
or vice versa. When `objects' get as complicated as operating systems
it does not really make sense to speak so simplistically.

   <p>If we want to say that a host `is a' server, we can code this as membership
in the set of servers:

<pre class="verbatim">classes:

  "servers"  or => { "host1", "host2" };

processes:

  servers::  # the next rules `extend' or add to the class servers

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How to organize your organization</h3>

<p>Faced with the choice of how to classify systems, where does one
begin?  This is the dilemma that programmers face when designing new
software, and if they make the wrong choices for their class
hierarchy, it can cost a lot of work to redesign everything again from
the beginning. This is why inheritance and strict class hierarchies
are a very fragile way of organizing something. Using a patchwork of
sets, CFEngine potentially avoids this problem &ndash; but you can still
make a mess &ndash; it seems to be programmed into us to put systems into
hierarchy-like `container' categories anyway, and this can end with
confusion.

   <p>The keyt issue is: how tdo we slice and dice the cake into the largest
pieces? In other words, what is that basic paradigm that you use to partition your
system operations? Some alternatives include:

     <ul>
<li>Geographically (by site or country)
<li>By business department (sales, accounting, research)
<li>By security zone (private, DMZ, public, etc)
<li>By operating system (solaris, linux, darwin)
<li>By customer or client (e.g. for managed services)
<li>By task, service or role in the network (webservers, dns, workstations)
</ul>

   <p>However, you choose to begin, you can further subdivide these major categories
by simply ANDing with other categories.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Applications of hierarchy</h3>

<p>When a small organization uses CFEngine, machines are often configured by
"what they do" or "what they have" (<i>e.g.,</i> they "are a webserver" or they
"have ntp-based time synchronization").  These attributes are best expressed
using CFEngine classes (and class promises), so that the <code>.cf</code> files
can simply express configuration options based on "has-a" or "is-a" options.

   <p>For example:

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent maintain_servers
{ 
classes:
        "has_dhcpd"	or	=> { classmatch("ipv4_10_\d+_\d+_1") };
	"has_httpd"	or	=> { "www_example_com" };
	"has_sshd"	or	=> { "any" };

processes:
    has_dhcpd::
	"dhcpd"		restart_class => "start_dhcpd";

    has_httpd::
	"httpd"		restart_class => "start_httpd";

    has_sshd::
	"sshd"		restart_class => "start_sshd";

commands:
    freebsd.start_dhcpd::
	"/usr/local/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd.sh start";

    start_httpd::
	"/usr/local/sbin/apachectl start";

    freebsd.start_sshd::
	"/etc/rc.d/sshd start";

    linux.start_sshd::
	"/etc/init.d/ssh start";
}
</pre>

<p class="noindent">As you can see, the #1 machine on every net-10 subnet has the dhcp
server for that subnet, the machine <code>www.example.com</code> has a web server,
and every machine has an ssh server.

   <p>But what happens when we want to maintain configuration information
differently for different regions, or different IP addresses?  Our usage of
classes can get complicated, and can obscure the the details of what you want
CFEngine to maintain.  For example, if we want to maintain both internal and
external webservers for different parts of a larger corporation, we might see
something like this:

<pre class="verbatim">files:
    internal.has_httpd.nyc::
	# Files maintained for internal webserver in New York

    external.has_httpd.nyc::
	# Files maintained for external webserver in New York

    internal.has_httpd.london::
	# Files maintained for internal webserver in London

    external.has_httpd.london::
	# Files maintained for external webserver in London

    internal.has_httpd.tokyo::
	# Files maintained for internal webserver in Tokyo

    external.has_httpd.tokyo::
	# Files maintained for external webserver in Tokyo
</pre>

<p class="noindent">When you compound this by ading more services, locations, and finer
and finer discriminations, the configuration files can rapidly grow so
complicated as to obfuscate the intentions.

   <p>To be sure, having classes like <code>nyc</code>, <code>london</code>, and <code>tokyo</code>
can be very useful when using CFEngine to centrally administer a large
network of computers, but there are other ways of doing this that make
maintenance easier and the logic more apparent.

   <p>1) Copying files to local machines
2) Symlinks
3) Local changes $(site_local)
4) Machine naming -&gt; classes
5) Using dist classes to select from a set of machines, not just query them
    in order; also splayclass
6) Versioning, RPM/SVN for distro, vs CFEngine
7) updating with cf-agent -DUpdateNow
