<h3 class="section">1.1 CFEngine 3 Enterprise - the new CFEngine 3 Nova!</h3>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise is the next generation of CFEngine 3 Nova, upgraded with productivity and performance enhancements. We have made a new Mission Portal Engineering room tailored to the needs of infrastructure engineers, making it both easier and more powerful to use. Most notably we have introduced dynamic grouping of hosts through a flexible tree control, also referred to as the Navigation Tree. It allows system adminsitrators to flexibly group hosts based on CFEngine classes, both discovered (hard classes such as operating system, architecture, IP address, etc.) and user defined (soft classes such as webserver, development, staging, etc).

   <p>CFEngine 3 Nova is completely compatible with CFEngine 3 Enterprise and can easily be upgraded by following the instructions in this document.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Hardware requirements</h3>

<p>The default CFEngine 3 Enterprise architecture uses a single hub, or policy server, to publish changes of policy
and to aggregate knowledge about the environment, but you can set up as many as you like to manage
different parts of your organization independently. The CFEngine technology is not centralized by
nature. Most users choose to centralize updating of policy and report aggregation for convenience
however.

   <p>The default architecture and configuration skeleton of CFEngine 3 Enterprise is expected to scale to a few thousand hosts with a
dedicated policy hub. In such a case, your hub machine should have at least 2 GB of memory and a modern processor. 
For machines under CFEngineâ€™s management (clients), a full installation of CFEngine 3 Enterprise requires about 20 MB of disk storage. Otherwise disk usage depends on your specific policies, especially those that concern reporting. Each software component (agent) typically uses under 10 MB of memory, but spikes in memory usage can occur if several agents run simultaneously. CFEngine recommends to have 256 MB available memory on the clients.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Operating system support</h3>

<p>CFEngine can be made to run on most operating systems. For efficiency
CFEngine only supports packages for a number of recent popular operating systems,
which should be up to date with patches. If we don't have packages for
your particular operating systems we can usually make packages by
special arrangement please contact your sales representative.

   <p>The hub (policy server) is only available for derivatives of the
top GNU/Linux distributions (Debian, Red Hat, SuSE, Ubuntu), as these make available
software that the hub relies on for data storage and processing. 
Operating system choices for the hub are:

<pre class="example">      Debian 6
      Ubuntu 8.04, 10.04, 12.04
      RHEL/CentOS 5, 6
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Operating system choices for the clients are:
<pre class="example">     AIX 5.3, 6.1, CentOS 5, 6, Debian 5, 6, Fedora 14, 15, 16, FreeBSD 7, 8,
     HP-UX, NetBSD 4.0, 5.0, NetBSD 5.1, openSUSE 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3,
     11.4, RHEL 4, 5, 6, SLES 9, 10, 11, SUSE Linux 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 10.0, 10.1,
     Solaris 8, 9, 10, Solaris 10, Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, 9.10, 10.04, 10.10,
     11.04, 11.10, 12.04, Windows XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003, Server 2008
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See <samp><span class="file">Release Notes CFEngine 3 Enterprise.txt</span></samp> for details on supported architectures.

   <p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise provides a version of CFEngine running natively on Windows, with support for registry management, Windows services and file security, See <a href="#Windows_002dspecific-features-in-CFEngine-3-Enterprise">Windows-specific features in CFEngine 3 Enterprise</a>. Support for Solaris zones has been added through automated zone detection and process model adaptation.

   <p>A working package manager is required on the hub/policy server to install an Apache Web Server, php module, MongoDB, subversion, etc. You should start from a blank system (i.e. with none of these components installed) to avoid potential interference with the installation process. No special software is otherwise required on machines in your network, CFEngine bundles all critical dependencies in the Enterprise package.

</div>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Installation procedure</h3>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise is designed to be simple to install in its default configuration. The installation
process has three phases:

     <ul>
<li>Unpacking the software. 
<li>Obtaining a license. 
<li>Adapting policy. 
</ul>

   <p>You should start from a blank system See <a href="#Hardware-requirements">Hardware requirements</a>. If you have been using CFEngine Community Edition and you have
already developed a policy, set aside this policy during the installation process. You will be able
to integrate it back later.

   <p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise is provided in two packages, <samp><span class="file">cfengine-nova_&lt;VERSION NUMBER&gt;</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">cfengine-nova-expansion_&lt;VERSION NUMBER&gt;</span></samp>. The main software package
must be installed on every host (including the hub). The expansion package is only installed on the policy hub. You should install and set up the hub first.

   <p>References to package managers assume that additional packages might need to be installed on the hub (policy server). Root privilege is required for the installation.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Verify that the machine's network connection is working and that port 5308 is open for both incoming and outgoing connections (to assure communication between the hub and clients). On the hub, verify that package managers <code>yum</code>,
<code>zypper</code> or <code>apt-get</code> are working. They will be used to
install a web server, database, php server and subversion. If you are not able to set up a package manager and
repository on the hub, please See <a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a>, for manual installation.

     <li>Copy the CFEngine 3 Enterprise packages to the system. On the hub (policy server):
     <pre class="example">          cfengine-nova_2.1.<var>xxx.[rpm|deb]</var>
          cfengine-nova-expansion_2.1.<var>xxx.[rpm|deb]</var>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">On all other machines:
     <pre class="example">          cfengine-nova_2.1.<var>xxx.[rpm|deb]</var>
</pre>
     <li>Unpack the software:
          <dl>
<dt><i>Red Hat family</i><dd>
          <pre class="example">               host# rpm -ihv <var>packages</var>
</pre>
          <br><dt><i>SUSE family</i><dd>
          <pre class="example">               host# rpm -ihv <var>packages</var>
</pre>
          <br><dt><i>Debian family</i><dd>
          <pre class="example">               host# dpkg --install  <var>packages</var>
</pre>
          </dl>

     <li>On the hub, a public key has now been created in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub</span></samp> as part of the
package installation. You should send this public key to CFEngine Support<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> as an attachment in the ticket system,
to obtain a license file <samp><span class="file">license.dat</span></samp>.

     <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
Save the returned license file to <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/license.dat</span></samp>
on the hub before continuing. 
</td></tr></table>

     <p>See more details for the software licensing here;
<a href="https://cfengine.com/software/Licensing.pdf">https://cfengine.com/software/Licensing.pdf</a>

     <li>The remaining steps apply to all hosts, but you should install the hub or policy server first. For large systems (&gt; 1000 hosts) we recommend increasing the memory limit in php.ini on the hub (for instance to 128 MB).

     <p>Find the hostname or IP address of the hub (policy server), here we assume &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">123.456.789.123</span></samp>&rsquo; is the address. 
<pre class="verbatim">      hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
</pre>
Use the same command on all hosts, i.e. *** do not bootstrap the policy server with a localhost address ***
If you mistype the address of the hub, we recommend doing the following steps to re-boostrap. 
<pre class="verbatim">      hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.124
      hub # killall cf-execd cf-serverd cf-monitord cf-hub
      hub # rm -rf /var/cfengine/inputs/*
      hub # rm -f /var/cfengine/policy_server.dat
      hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
</pre>

     <p>CFEngine will output diagnostic information upon bootstrap (written to command line and syslog; cf-agent will also return a value: ERROR: 1, SUCCESS: 0). Error messages will be displayed if bootstrapping failed, pursue these to get an indication of what went wrong and correct accordingly. If all is well you should see the following in the output:

     <pre class="verbatim">     
     -> Bootstrap to 123.456.789.123 completed successfully
     
</pre>

     <li>CFEngine should now be up and running on your system. It will copy its default policy files into <samp><span class="file">masterfiles</span></samp> on the hub (policy server) provided that the directory is empty (fresh install). When the clients are bootstrapped, they will contact the hub and copy them to their <samp><span class="file">inputs</span></samp> directory.

     <li>To complete licensing setup, you should make a promise to accept the license
terms by editing <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf</span></samp>
on the hub (policy server), changing the line &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">host_licenses_paid =&gt; "&lt;NUMBER&gt;";</span></samp>&rsquo;
in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">body common control</span></samp>&rsquo; to reflect the correct number of licenses that you have subscribed to.

        </ol>

<p class="noindent"><b>How to assess success in this procedure:</b>

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Look at the process list on the systems with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ps waux | grep cf-</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You should be able to see <code>cf-execd</code> running, and eventually other processes from
the CFEngine suite like <code>cf-monitord</code> <code>cf-serverd</code>. On the hub, you should
also eventually see <code>cf-hub</code>. Note that it may take 5&ndash;10 minutes before all the
processes get started.

     <li>Look for files in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp> (Unix)
or <samp><span class="file">C:\Program Files\Cfengine\inputs</span></samp> (Windows). The license
file will be copied out from the policy server to the clients as part
of the normal distribution of policy. Each machine should get a
copy of the <samp><span class="file">license.dat</span></samp> file in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs</span></samp>
(Unix) or <samp><span class="file">C:\Program Files\Cfengine\inputs</span></samp> (Windows).

     <li>On the hub, the file <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/promise_knowledge.cf</span></samp> should have been
created, and should contain data.

     <li>Finally, try to connect to the web server at port 80 on the hub/policy host (for example at http://123.456.789.123). 
You should see a login page like the one shown in the figure below:

     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     <div align="center"><img src="img-login.png" alt="Mission Portal login"></div>
     <div align="center">Figure: Mission Portal login screen</div>
     <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     
     Default user name and password is 'admin' and 'admin' (make sure to change this at first login to prevent unauthorized access; but see also Appendix A on configuration of LDAP).
        </ol>

   <p>Note that some of the displays in the Mission Portal may be blank when you log in just after installation; some reports and graphs are only updated every six hours. It may also take some time for the system to fully converge, do not get troubled if initially there are some promises repaired or not kept.

<p>See INSTALLATION.TXT (can be found on the CFEngine software download page: <a href="https://cfengine.com/software/">https://cfengine.com/software/</a>) for a list of dependencies for the hub.

   <p>To install the packages you might want to use <code>yum</code> on Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora,
<code>zypper</code> on SUSE or <code>apt</code> on Debian/Ubuntu.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="subsection">3.2.2 Why do I get a promise failed with the message <code>Can't stat</h4>

<p>/var/cfengine/master_software_updates/SOME-OS</code> on some hosts?

   <p>There is a built-in promise to automatically upgrade the CFEngine 3 Enterprise
binaries. By default, the clients will check for an update package
every time CFEngine 3 Enterprise runs. So if the clients find that there is no source
directory to download the files from, the message will be displayed.

   <p>To fix the problem, simply create an empty directory mentioned in the
message on the hub.
<pre class="verbatim"> hub # mkdir /var/cfengine/master_software_updates/SOME-OS
</pre>

<!--  -->
<h4 class="subsection">3.2.3 I did bootstrap the hub <em>before</em> obtaining a license file, what should I do?</h4>

<p>Four steps need to be followed to correct this minor issue.
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>obtain a working license file and copy it to <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp>
<pre class="verbatim">      hub # cp /tmp/license.dat /var/cfengine/masterfiles
</pre>
<li>killall CFEngine running processes
<pre class="verbatim">      hub # killall cf-execd cf-serverd cf-monitord cf-hub
</pre>
<li>wipe out <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/inputs </span></samp>
<pre class="verbatim">      hub # rm -rf /var/cfengine/inputs
</pre>
<li>bootstrap the policy hub
<pre class="verbatim">      hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
</pre>
        </ol>

<!--  -->
<h4 class="subsection">3.2.4 On my hub, I get messages of connection failures to a database. For example, in <code>messages</code>, I can see something like <code>!! Could not open connection to report database for saving</code>. What should I do?</h4>

<p>This message comes from the <code>cf-hub</code> process. It is responsible
for pulling reports from hosts that have contacted the hub to get
policy updates. When these reports are fetched, they are stored in a local MongoDB database on the hub. This message is produced when there is a failure in the connection to the database.

   <p>Probably, the issue is that the database server is not running on your
hub. Run the <code>ps</code>-command to check this.
<pre class="verbatim"> hub # ps -e | grep mongod
</pre>

   <p>If the <code>mongod</code> process <em>is</em> running, it must be
misconfigured or in some bad state. Please look at the newest entry in
<samp><span class="file">/var/log/mongod.log</span></samp> to diagnose the problem, and contact
CFEngine Technical Support if necessary.

   <p>If the <code>mongod</code> process <em>is not</em> running, please follow the
steps below.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Run
  hub # <code>/var/cfengine/bin/cf-twin -Kvf failsafe.cf &gt; /tmp/cfout</code>
<li>Check again if the <code>mongod</code> is running, if so, the problem
is probably fixed now. 
<li>If <code>mongod</code> is still not running, please search the output
file for lines starting as follows.

     <pre class="verbatim">     ...
     nova>  -> Making a one-time restart promise for mongod
     ...
     ...
     nova>  -> Executing '/var/cfengine/bin/mongod....
     nova>  -> Backgrounding job /var/cfengine/bin/mongod...
     nova>  -> Completed execution of /var/cfengine/bin/mongod...
     ...
</pre>

     <p>If you don't see the first line above, CFEngine 3 Enterprise does not try to start
<code>mongod</code> &mdash; so check if you bootstrapped your hub correctly. If
you see all lines, it means that CFEngine 3 Enterprise starts <code>mongod</code>, but the process just
terminates immediately after. If so, continue to the next step.

     <li>Look at the newest entry in <samp><span class="file">/var/log/mongod.log</span></samp>. It
should give you more details of why the <code>mongod</code> process refuses
to start. The two most common scenarios are described next.

     <li>If <code>mongod</code> has been terminated unexpectedly, it might have
left a lock-file behind that stops it from starting again. Try
deleting <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/state/mongod.lock</span></samp> if it exists.

     <li>If the database is corrupted, you can have <samp><span class="file">mongod</span></samp> create a new one by moving
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/state/cf-report.*</span></samp> out of the way. There are also
tools and documentation for repairing a database at
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">http://www.mongodb.org/</a>.

     <p>Note that almost all of the <code>cfreport</code> database is recreated with data collected from clients. This happens every 5 minutes or 6 hours (depending on the probe), you may consider whether deleting the database is an acceptable solution. CFEngine AS or CFEngine Inc can not be held responsible for data loss in this respect.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Upgrading to CFEngine 3 Enterprise</h2>

<p>When upgrading the software from an earlier version, you should
upgrade the hub (policy server) machine first. Any other hosts
in your network that act as servers for encrypted copy operations
would preferably be upgraded next. This is because a stronger form of
encryption-hash is used in newer versions, which the older servers
cannot understand.

   <p>CFEngine packages its software in operating system compatible package
formats (RPM, DEB, PKG, MSI, etc). New packages are made available on the
cfengine.com website; these can be downloaded and installed
in the standard way.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Go to <a href="https://cfengine.com/software">https://cfengine.com/software</a> (login required)
<li>Download the particular package for your operating systems

<h3 class="section">4.1 Upgrade procedure</h3>

<p>The following is a general procedure to upgrade to CFEngine 3 Enterprise from earlier versions. It is assumed that the packages are placed in the <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> directory. To upgrade, start with the hub (policy server):

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Stop all CFE processes
<pre class="verbatim">        $ /etc/init.d/cfengine3 stop
     or
        $ for i in cf-execd cf-serverd cf-monitord cf-hub mongod; do pkill $i; done
</pre>

     <li>Upgrade cfengine-nova and cfengine-nova-expansion <br>
[RedHat/CentOS/SUSE]
<pre class="verbatim">        $ rpm -Uvh /tmp/cfengine-nova-2.2.x-y.x86_64.rpm /tmp/cfengine-nova-
        expansion-2.2.x-y.x86_64.rpm
</pre>
[Debian/Ubuntu]
<pre class="verbatim">        $ dpkg --install /tmp/cfengine-nova_2.2.x-y_x86_64.deb /tmp/cfengine-nova-
        expansion_2.2.x-y_x86_64.deb
</pre>

     <li>CFEngine 3 Enterprise's dependencies have changed so we have to correct cf-twin (libgnutls and libmongo.c were updated)
<pre class="verbatim">        $ cp /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent /var/cfengine/bin/cf-twin
</pre>

     <li>Remove Mongodb lock if present
<pre class="verbatim">        $ rm -f /var/cfengine/state/mongod.lock
</pre>

     <li>Copy the new CFE_ prefixed policy files to $(sys.workdir)/masterfiles (the files with a prefix "CFE_" are maintained by CFEngine, do not make changes to these, they are there to ensure that the Mission Portal works properly). 
<pre class="verbatim">        $ cd /var/cfengine/share/NovaBase
        $ cp CFE_cfengine.cf CFE_knowledge.cf CFE_hub_specific.cf 
        company_knowledge.cf /var/cfengine/masterfiles
     
     [optional: do this when all hosts run Nova 2.2.0]
     $ cp /var/cfengine/share/NovaBase/cfengine_stdlib.cf /var/cfengine/masterfiles
</pre>
Comments:
          <ul>
<li>CFE_cfengine.cf
    - contains
<pre class="verbatim">                     bundle agent cfengine_management{}
     </pre>
      and agent bundles for all CFEngine 3 Enterprise hosts. 
<li>CFE_knowledge.cf
    - mostly CFEngine 3 Enterprise Knowledge Map setup
<li>CFE_hub_specific.cf
    - all necessary bundles to build the CFEngine 3 Enterprise HUB (policy server) is in this file
<li>company_knowledge.cf
    - a custom Knowledge Map configuration. You may add any information you'd like to incorporate your company knowledge into the CFEngine 3 Enterprise Knowledge Map
<li>cfengine_stdlib.cf
    - the latest standard CFEngine bodies and bundles
<li>If you are using an <samp><span class="file">update.cf</span></samp> file older than from the Nova 2.0.2 release: package_method has been updated, the Nova/Enterprise self-upgrade will not work properly on some systems. We strongly recommended to synchronise contents of the file before rolling out new packages to clients. (Please contact your sales representative or file a ticket in the CFEngine support system to help you out.) 
</ul>

     <li>Upgrade from Nova 2.0.x (skip this step if you run Nova 2.1.x): Modify contents in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf</span></samp>
          <ul>
<li>Correct input files in
<pre class="verbatim">             "inputs => {}";
     </pre>
               <ul>
<li>Change cfengine.cf to CFE_cfengine.cf
<li>Change knowledge.cf to CFE_knowledge.cf
<li>Add CFE_hub_specific.cf
<li>"inputs" should look similiar to this after changes:
<pre class="verbatim">                  inputs => {
                             "CFE_cfengine.cf",
                             "CFE_hub_specific.cf",
                             "CFE_knowledge.cf",
                             "update.cf",
                             "cfengine_stdlib.cf",
                             "environment_$(environments.active)/promises.cf",
               	      &lt;YOUR OWN INPUT FILES>
                            };
          </pre>
</ul>

          <li>Add "commercial_customer" class to
<pre class="verbatim">             "bundle common def{}"
          
             classes:
              "commercial_customer" or => { "nova_edition"},
                         comment => "Define a global class for CFEngine 3 Enterprise",
                          handle => "common_def_classes_commercial_customer";
     </pre>

          <li>Delete the whole
<pre class="verbatim">             bundle agent cfengine_management{}
     </pre>
(It was moved to CFE_hub_specific.cf)

          <li>Add <code>"track_value"</code> to <code>"body agent control</code>"
<pre class="verbatim">             any:
              track_value => "true";
     </pre>
</ul>

     <li>Modify a line in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles/update.cf</span></samp> to run mongod as follows (line 242 if upgrade from 2.1.x, line 299 if upgrade from 2.0.x; the line has been split and indented for presentability below):
<pre class="verbatim">        "/var/cfengine/bin/mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongod.log --dbpath $
           (sys.workdir)/state --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --nohttpinterface â€“nojournal
           --logappend > /dev/null &lt; /dev/null 2>&amp;1"
</pre>

     <li>Tidy up $(sys.doc_root) directory<br>
[Debian/Ubuntu]
<pre class="verbatim">        $ rm -rf /var/www/*
</pre>
[RHEL/CentOS]
<pre class="verbatim">        $ rm -rf /var/www/html/*
</pre>
[SLES/openSUSE]
<pre class="verbatim">        $ rm -rf /srv/www/htdocs/*
</pre>

     <li>Restart CFEngine processes
<pre class="verbatim">        $ /etc/init.d/cfengine3 start
     or
        $ /var/cfengine/bin/cf-execd
</pre>

     <li>You will need to re-initialize the MongoDB if you have trouble logging in after upgrade, see See <a href="#First-time-login-to-Mission-Portal-fails">First time login to Mission Portal fails</a>.
        </ol>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
For client upgrades there are 2 approaches: manual or automatic upgrade.
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Manual: Update cfengine-nova on each client by <code>rpm</code> or <code>dpkg</code> command. Update cf-twin as described in step 3 in the update procedure for the hub (i.e. overwrite the old cf-twin). 
<li>Automatic: On the hub, copy the cfengine-nova packages to the operating system specific distribution directories in <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/master_software_updates</span></samp> (i.e. put the files in the respective operating specific subdirectories) and CFEngine 3 Enterprise will take care of the rest.
        </ol>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise comes with policies that are specific to Enterprise functionality, we therefore urge you to set aside your
current community policy. Install CFEngine 3 Enterprise, set up the Enterprise hub by
following this document, and then integrate your existing
policy to the hub manually, in small testable steps.

   <p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise is compatible with the Community Edition of CFEngine 3, but
some process files are now managed by CFEngine 3 Enterprise for user convenience.

<p>Mission Engineering illustrates the state of the system in relation to the desired state at all scales. Zoom in to specific areas and examine the impact of promises, query data, and extract reports.

   <p>The Mission Engineering room underwent a substantial rework for the release of CFEngine 3 Enterprise 2.2. Most notably we introduced a host Navigation Tree where hosts can be grouped and organized in a hierarchy defined by classes. The remaining content on the page is influenced by the selected tree context, i.e. the <b>Status</b> and <b>Reports</b> tabs will only show information for linux hosts if such a context/node is selected in the the tree (the active node is highlighted to show that it is selected). Another notable change is the new interface to interact with reports, now available as a tab and drop-down menus.

<p>The Status tab shows the overall status of the hosts selected in the Navigation Tree. This section contains:
     <ul>
<li>Selected context: Shows the context (combination of selected classes) for which the data is valid. 
<li>Compliance Summary: The row of bars shows the compliance of all registered hosts in blocks of five minutes for the last six hours or for the last week (depending on which is selected at the bottom of the graph)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The hosts are classified into red, yellow and green according to the status of their compliance (see below). The height of a bar corresponds to the number of registered hosts. Note that the last column may have a lower height than the others (i.e. show information for fewer hosts)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Click on a bar to see which promises were repaired or not kept. 
<li>Host Compliance (last hour): The hosts are classified into red, yellow and green according to the status of their compliance over the last hour:
          <ul>
<li>A host is red if more than 20% of its promises are not kept
<li>A host is yellow if 20% or more of its promises were repaired and host is now compliant (&gt; 20% repaired, now compliant)
<li>A host is green if more than 80% of its promises are kept (&gt; 80% compliant)
</ul>
     <li>Host Operations: The hosts are classified into blue and black according to their operational status.
          <ul>
<li>A host is blue if there has not been any contact between the hub and the client within a set time interval (host unreachable; default value is set to 15 minutes, see <a href="#Mission-Portal-Settings">Mission Portal Settings</a>). 
<li>A host is black if CFEngine's scheduling daemon, <code>execd</code>, is not running (the hub will still able to contact the client to collect reports but the client will return stale data since it has not been running at regular intervals). 
</ul>
     <li>Clicking a link in any of the above categories (red/yellow/green/blue/black) produces a list of the hosts in that category (in the above mentioned context).

     <p>Example, Compliant hosts: Click the link next to the green box under Host Compliance, a report appears showing host names, time stamp of last data collected and three action icons:

Business Value and Host Status:
The two pie charts show the business value of the promises kept/not kept and well as host status, respectively. Business value is associated with the value of promises as defined in policy files. In the Host Status chart, each host represents a slice of the pie and is classified into red, yellow, green and blue according to the level of their compliance. A host is red if less than 80% of its promises are kept, yellow if 20% or more of its promises were repaired and host is now compliant, green if more than 80% of its promises are kept, and blue if there is no contact between the hub and the client host (unreachable).

   <p>Compliance Summary:
The row of bar meters shows the compliance (average percentage of promises kept, repaired or not kept) of all registered hosts <a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a> in blocks of 6 hours for the past week. It summarizes performance and anomalous behavior in a simple red (promises not kept), yellow (promises repaired) and green (promises kept) scale. Click on a bar to see which promises were kept/not kept.

   <p>Services/Goals:

<h4 class="subsection">5.3.5 Topics viewer (Knowledge map)</h4>

<p>The Topics viewer, or Knowledge map, is a <i>sematic web</i> of subject references and document pointers. In a semantic web, you are presented with links to
documents about your chosen topic. In addition you are
offered <i>leads</i> and possible pathways to topics that are known to be
related. These leads don't just point you to more documents, but
explain <i>how</i> neighboring issues are related.  The aim is to help
the user learn from the experience of browsing, by conveying the
meaning of the current topic in relation to other issues in the
system. This is how <i>knowledge transfer</i> occurs.

   <p>The Knowledge Map can be found by searching for a topic in the top right corner or through the topic finder in the Mission Library (this will sometimes also lead directly to a document or web page instead).

The yellow sphere represents the current topic, surrounding (blue) spheres represent related topics, and the size of the spheres represents the number of associations each topic has. This map is navigable: click on a different topic to see a new view centered on that topic and its associations. The tabs will show leads, references, topics in the same context, and sub topics in the same context. Links can also lead to other viewers in the Mission Portal, documents and web pages related to the current topic.

Clicking a different report or saved search from one of these menus will refresh the page content to reflect the selection.

   <p>The Report viewer also comes with different tools to drill down to specific information in the current report. To assist in this, the top line shows for how many hosts the report is valid for, along with an icon for selecting host context (the host context is pre-populated with data from the selected node in the Navigation Tree) and the title of the current report.

Clicking the icon for selecting host context will bring up a window where the user can choose classes to include and exclude in a refined search on the current report (excludes takes priority over includes):

<h4 class="subsection">5.4.1 Policy editor</h4>

<p>The CFEngine 3 Enterprise Mission Portal provides an editor for working on
CFEngine language. The editor provides syntax high-lighting and look-up to make working
with CFEngine's extensive language easier. There is a tie-in for Subversion version
control repositories; the Mission Portal will prompt you for the path and login credentials. Setup of a subversion repository has to be done separately.

The CFEngine 3 Enterprise policy editor detects syntax errors and highlights
these in red to avoid mistakes when editing.  In addition, by using
the <code>Check syntax</code> button, it is possible to pre-test the policy
before committing changes to a repository. This will run
<code>promises.cf</code> through the <code>cf-promises</code> parser.

   <p>The main menu on the left hand panel shows the main work flow items for
policy editing. Clicking the arrow in the panel divider collapses the
menu and gives full-screen editing.

   <p>The right hand panel shows basic file and Subversion commands. The <code>Save</code> button will store a local/version of the opened files without committing to the repository.

<h4 class="subsection">5.4.2 Integration with subversion</h4>

<p>The default architecture proposes to work in close dialog with a version
repository. CFEngine recommends the use of such a repository and currently
supports subversion.

   <p>todo2 For the moment, user management in the Mission Portal only concerns access to the Mission Portal settings and, through role-based access control, access to hosts, repo. It does not affect the ability to edit or approve policies in the policy editor. Access control and authorization for policies are handled by
subversion's authentication system so that edits made in the Mission
Portal can be interleaved with edits from other sources.  The
subversion repository thus becomes the centerpiece of the distributed
coordination, as is the intended function of version control systems.

   <p>When working with a subversion repository, you first do a
&rdquo;checkout&rdquo;. This allows you to select the repository you want to
download and creates a working environment based on it. Note that the
editor currently only views files in the checked out repository, so if
you have a directory hierarchy, you need to check out multiple
times. After doing a checkout, you can view the path to the current
repository at the top.

<!-- @sp 1 -->
<!-- @center @image{editor-svnpath,6cm,,Path to the current repository} -->
<!-- @center Figure: Path to the current repository. -->
<!-- @sp 1 -->
   <p>The &rdquo;update&rdquo; command downloads the newest files from the already checked
out subversion repository, while &rdquo;commit&rdquo; updates the repository
with your working copy. After editing you may or may not commit changes. When closing an
edited file, you are also given the option to commit at once. You also have the ability to see the
repository log of the 20 last changes; this includes changed files,
users and log messages.

<!-- @sp 1 -->
<!-- @center @image{savefiledlg,6cm,,The front page} -->
<!-- @center Figure: Save file with repository commit -->
<!-- @sp 1 -->
   <p>The menu choice to commit a current version commits all files in the
configuration repository. Commits require a mandatory comment. CFEngine recommends
you use this to explain why a change was made, or relate it to an incident number, etc. 
The details of <i>what</i> was changed are already documented by the version control
logs.

<!-- @center Figure: Updating the repository contents. -->
<!-- @sp 1 -->

   <p>Per default there are no automatic updates from the subversion repository to masterfiles as users may want to review changes before they go live. You would either need to copy new policies manually to <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> on the hub, or check out your subversion repository there and run svn update. It is however possible to set up automatic updates using CFEngine, for example by adding the following to your policy:

<pre class="verbatim">commands:

  am_policy_hub::

  "/usr/bin/svn update --non-interactive"

     comment => "Update masterfiles if new changes have been committed",
     contain => silent_in_dir("/var/cfengine/masterfiles");

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.5.1.4 Hub Replication Status</h5>

<p>The Mission Portal has a role to play in Mission Criticality, as it is a single source of information, collected, categorized and calibrated for system engineers. Being a single source website, it is can also be regarded as a single point of failure from the point of view of a mission critical application.

   <p>The information in the mission portal is largely status information about systems. The content of the Mission Portal database is not in any way deterministic for the configured state of your IT system â€“ it is only a report of actual state, not a template for intended state. If the Mission Portal is 'down' or unavailable, it does not in any way imply that the actual distributed system is down or that there is any fault.

   <p>If information and insight into your IT system are indeed Mission Critical for you, it is possible to create a high availability access to the mission information in the portal. CFEngine commercial editions support multiple 'hubs' for redundancy during reporting<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a>. By making a cluster of three (or more) hubs, you can ensure that reports will always be available and up to date, at the time-resolution promised by CFEngine.

   <p>To set up redundant hubs, you will need three physical computers, or at least three virtual machines on different physical computers. The idea is to use the underlying technology of the MongoDB database to provide a replicated data store. If a single database server goes down a secondary replica can take over the role. The commercial editions of CFEngine interface with this database through cf-hub, and this process can be made aware of the underlying replica technology in the database. The architecture is intended to be as simple as possible for the CFEngine user to employ. The basic steps include:

     <ul>
<li>Install each of the three systems with the Nova/Constellation extension package for policy hubs. 
<li>The MongoDB backend needs to be set up specially before standard bootstrapping of nodes in an high availability managed network. 
</ul>

   <p>Alternatively, if you have already bootstrapped hosts, you can manually establish hub redundancy with a little database infrastructure work and some additional CFEngine configuration.

   <p>In general, we recommend a small amount of professional services to help set up such a system, as there are several details that need to be taken into account.

<h4 class="subsection">5.5.2 Mission Portal User Admin</h4>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise 2.2.0 introduces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to the Mission Portal. RBAC limits access to the Mission Portal settings page and access to hosts, reports and promises. It does not affect the ability to edit or approve policies in the policy editor (access control and authorization for policies are handled by subversion's authentication system, see <a href="#Integration-with-subversion">Integration with subversion</a>). RBAC can be globally switched on or off in the Mission Portal settings (see <a href="#Mission-Portal-Settings">Mission Portal Settings</a>).

   <p>On a fresh install the default user "admin" belongs to the "admin" user group and has access to both the <b>User preferences and settings</b> page and the <b>User Administration</b> page. The "admin" user can add users to the internal database and define user roles (Admin, Faculty, Developer, etc.) for users from either the internal database or an external authentication database (LDAP or Active Directory; see <a href="#Mission-Portal-Settings">Mission Portal Settings</a> and <a href="#Configuration-of-external-authentication">Configuration of external authentication</a>).

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.5.2.1 User Roles</h5>

<p>The information a user is authorized to see is determined from his or her
role memberships. A user may be member of an arbitrary number of
roles, each which may grant and deny access to certain
information. User-authentication is carried out when users log in to the Mission Portal.

   <pre class="sp">

<img src="img-add-role-2-2.png" alt="Add Role">
<div align="center">Figure: Add Role</div>
<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Roles can be defined on either classes or bundles and involves setting permissions through an include and exclude list for each. 
The effective permissions of a user is the cumulative set of
permission granted or denied by his roles, and is used to filter the
information displayed in the following way:

     <ul>
<li>Create a union of the granted access for the roles. 
<li>Override with the rules that deny access for the roles. 
<li>If left unspecified, access is denied. 
</ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<b>Entities filtered:</b><br>
RBAC is supported on the <em>host</em> and <em>promise bundle</em> level,
each applying to different parts of the Mission Portal. Both these
entities are atomic with respect to RBAC &mdash; either a user can see
everything they contain, or nothing of it.

   <p>Access to a host is required to see any information about it, e.g. all
its reports (Engineering-&gt;Reports), host page, and compliance
category. If a user is not allowed access to a host, the Mission
Portal would look the same as if the host was not bootstrapped to that
hub.

   <p>Information about the running policy is also available in the Mission
Portal, either through the Promise Finder at the Engineering page, or
by clicking a promise handle from one of the reports. The searchable
promises in the Promise Finder and information pages about promises
and bundles are filtered in the same manner as the hosts, but defined
based on promise bundles instead. The Policy Editor is not covered by
RBAC &mdash; access to the policy source repository allows the user to see
the whole policy. Some version control systems can be configured to
only allow users to access sub-directories of the policy, which may
help in this case.

   <p>Note that the host and promise filtering is independent &mdash; no attempt
is made to try to infer which promises a role should have access to
based on the hosts it has access to or vice versa.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<b>Defining roles:</b><br>
From the above discussion, we see that a role is defined as reporting
access to a set of hosts and promise bundles from the Mission Portal
and REST API. This does not give any rights with respect to changing
the content or execution of the policy. It should not be confused with
the <code>roles</code> promise-type that can be used by <code>cf-runagent</code>
and <code>cf-serverd</code>.

   <p>In order to scale, both entities are
defined as a set of <em>regular expressions</em> to allow and
deny.

   <p>Access to hosts is defined by regular expressions on <em>classes</em>,
not the hostname, ip, or any other name. This is done to ensure
maximum scalability. Classes can be arbitrarily defined in the
CFEngine policy language, so this incurs no loss of flexibility, but
ensures distributed computation.

   <p>In contrast to users, a role definition and membership can only be
obtained from the internal Mission Portal database. This means that
any roles must be defined through the Mission Portal web interface,
and can not be obtained from e.g. LDAP at this time. The rationale is
that querying complex LDAP structures for role membership is too
inefficient and error-prone. This may change in future releases, if
requested. Note that the <em>possible members</em> of a role can be
obtained from other sources, as described in the section on user
administration. However, assigning possible members to roles must be
done through the Mission Portal user-interface.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<b>Limitations to role-base access control:</b><br>
     <ul>
<li>Notes added in the Mission Portal are not filtered: they can be
seen by all users (including notes added to any host page). 
<li>The Knowledge Map is only available for members of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">admin</span></samp>&rsquo; role when RBAC is switched on. 
<li>Running <code>cf-report</code> from the command-line on the hub will
bypass all RBAC checks.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Monitoring extensions</h2>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise incorporates a lightweight monitoring agent, whose aim
is to provide meaningful performance data about systems, in a scalable
fashion.  CFEngine 3 Enterprise does not aim to replace specialized
rapid-update monitoring and alarm systems; it provides a context-aware
summary of current state that is always displayed in relation to
previous system behavior, for comparison. The aim is to offer useful
analytics rather than jump-to alarms.

   <p>CFEngine's monitoring component <code>cf-monitord</code> records a number of
performance data about the system by default. These include process
counts, service traffic, load average and CPU utilization and
temperature when available.  In the Community Edition, data are
only collected and stored for personal use, but users have to work to see
results.  CFEngine 3 Enterprise improves on this in three ways.

     <ul>
<li>Data collected from the monitoring system are integrated into
the aggregate knowledge console.

     <li>It adds a three year life-cycle trend summary, based on
`shift'-averages.

     <li>It adds customizable promises to monitor or
log specific highly specific user data through the generic promise
interface.

   </ul>

   <p>The end result is to display time series traces of system performance, like the
above mentioned values, and customized logs feeding custom-defined
reports.

<h3 class="section">6.1 Integration of monitoring with knowledge base</h3>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise integrates monitoring reports with the automated base
knowledge to provide self-analysis and simple summary reporting;
the Mission Portal shows important status summaries and allow users to drill down to specific reporting data.

<div align="center"><img src="img-status.png" alt="Integrated Monitoring"></div>

   <p>Detailed time-series views can be collected and collated, providing
honest and accurate data that allow you to gauge your own confidence
level in system performance.  Unlike most monitoring solutions,
CFEngine shows you its own confidence in the measurements taken. It
takes a finite amount of time to measure and transport data from
systems to the knowledge console. That time also provides information
about system performance. CFEngine always promises to tell you how old
data are and how confident it is in the values.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Custom promises to measure</h3>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise adds a new promise type in bundles for the monitoring
agent. These are written just like all other promises within a bundle
destined for the agent concerned. In this case:

<pre class="verbatim">bundle monitor watch

{
measurements:

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.1 Extraction strings and logging</h4>

<p>Let's take a generic example. Suppose we have a file of nonsense  <samp><span class="file">/tmp/testmeasure</span></samp>
and we want to extract some information that we call a `blonk'
from the file. A blonk is always on the second line of this file following
a prefix `Blonk blonk '. We would get the value like this:

<pre class="verbatim">
  "/tmp/testmeasure"

      handle => "blonk_watch",
      stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "string",
      history_type => "log",
      units => "blonks",
      match_value => find_blonks,
      action => sample_min("10");

</pre>

   <p>This promise body has several attributes.

     <dl>
<dt><code>handle</code><dd>It is essential to give measurement promises handles, as these are used to label the
log files that will store the values.

     <br><dt><code>stream_type</code><dd>Tells us that we are reading from what the system considered to be a regular file
on the file-system.

     <br><dt><code>data_type</code><dd>This says that data are to be treated as text with no other meaning.

     <br><dt><code>history_type</code><dd>This tells us that we want to log the values with a time stamp.

     <br><dt><code>units</code><dd>This string is used in documentation to explain the measurement units of this result.

     <br><dt><code>match_value</code><dd>This is a body reference that represents the algorithm by which we extract data from the file.

     <br><dt><code>action</code><dd>This is the generic action parameter that may be added to all promises. We use it
here to limit the sample rate of this promise; <code>cf-monitord</code> samples by default
at a rate of once per 2.5 minutes. 
</dl>

   <p>The matching body uses a method for selecting the correct line, and a way
for extracting a pattern from the line. In every case the value extracted
is described  by using a regular expression <i>back-reference</i>, i.e. 
a parenthesized expression  within a regular expression. The expression should
match the entire line and should contain exactly one parenthesis.

<pre class="verbatim">body match_value find_blonks
{
select_line_number => "2";
extraction_regex => "Blonk blonk ([blonk]+).*";
}
</pre>

   <p>The sampling rate is controlled by using the generic <code>action</code> constraint.
<pre class="verbatim">body action sample_min(x)
{
ifelapsed => "$(x)";
expireafter => "$(x)";
}
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.2 Extracting one-off numerical data</h4>

<p>In this example we extract an integer value from an existing file. 
Notice that CFEngine samples the process table during <code>processes</code>
promises so you might be able to save a new execution of a
shell command and use the cached data, depending on your need
for immediacy. It is always good practice to limit the system
load incurred by monitoring.

<pre class="verbatim">  # Test 2 - follow a special process over time
  # using CFEngine's process cache to avoid re-sampling

   "/var/cfengine/state/cf_rootprocs"

      handle => "monitor_self_watch",
      stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "int",
      history_type => "static",
      units => "kB",
      match_value => proc_value(".*cf-monitord.*",

         "root\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+([0-9]+).*");

</pre>

   <p>This match body selects a line matching a particular regular expression
and extracts the 6th column of the process table. The regular expression
skips first the root string and then five numerical values. 
The value is extracted into a one-off value

<pre class="verbatim">body match_value proc_value(x,y)
{
select_line_matching => "$(x)";
extraction_regex => "$(y)";

<p>Unlike most other monitoring tools that use heavy-weight scripting
languages to extract data, often running many processes for each
measurement, CFEngine is a lightweight probe, using file interfaces
and regular expressions. Thus its impact on the
system is minimal. The possibilities for using this are therefore
extremely broad:

     <ul>
<li>Extracting accounting data from systems for charge-back. 
This could be useful in cloud scenarios. 
<li>Discovering memory leaks. 
<li>Looking for zombie processes relating to specific software. 
<li>Logging up-time. 
<li>System class-dependent discovery and extraction of any kind of text
for insertion into a CMDB.

<h3 class="section">7.1 ACL Introduction</h3>

<p>Access Control Lists (ACL) allow for a more fine-grained access control on
file system objects than standard Unix permissions. In spite of the success
of the POSIX model's simplicity the functionality is limited.

   <p>File permission security is a subtle topic. Users should take care
when experimenting with ACLs as the results can often be
counter-intuitive. In some cases the functioning of a system can be
compromised by changes of access rights.

   <p>Not all file systems support ACLs. In Unix systems there is a plethora
of different file system types, which have different models of ACLs. 
Be aware that the mount-options for a file-system may affect the ACL
semantics.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<i>Note that when adding a user to a group, this will not have any
effect until the next time the user logs in on many operating
systems.</i>
</td></tr></table>

   <p>As CFEngine works across multiple platforms and needs to support ACLs
with different APIs, a common ACL syntax has been abstracted to add a
layer of portability. This is a specific feature of CFEngine, not of
the host systems. A generic syntax ensures that the ACLs that are
commonly needed can be coded in a portable fashion. CFEngine 3 Enterprise's
ACL model is translated into native permissions for implementation;
CFEngine does not interfere with native access mechanisms in any way. 
The CFEngine ACL syntax is similar to the POSIX ACL syntax, which is
supported by BSD, Linux, HP-UX and Solaris.

   <p>CFEngine also allows you to specify platform-dependent ACLs. Of
course, these ACLs will only work on the given platform, and must
therefore be shielded with classes that select the appropriate model
within the promise body.

   <p>Currently, CFEngine 3 Enterprise supports the following ACL APIs and operating
systems.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.1 Concepts</h4>

<p>As mentioned, there are many different ACL APIs. For example, the
POSIX draft standard, NTFS and NFSv4 have different and incompatible
ACL APIs. As CFEngine is cross-platform, these differences should, for
the most usual cases, be transparent to the user. However, some
distinctions are impossible to make transparent, and thus the user
needs to know about them.

   <p>We will explore the different concepts of ACL implementations that are
critical to understanding how permissions are defined and enforced in
the different file systems. As a running example, we will consider
NTFS ACLs and POSIX ACLs, because the distinction between these ACL
APIs is strong.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.2 Entity types</h4>

<p>All ACL APIs support three basic entity types: user, group and
all. User and group are simply users and groups of the system, where a
group may contain multiple users. all is all users of the system, this
type is called "other" in POSIX and "Everyone" in NTFS.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.3 Owners</h4>

<p>All file system objects have an owner, which by default is the entity
that created the object. The owner can always be a user. However, in
some file systems, groups can also be owners (e.g. the
"Administrators" group in NTFS). In some ACL APIs (e.g POSIX),
permissions can be set explicitly for the owner, i.e. the owner has an
independent ACL entry.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.4 Changing owner</h4>

<p>It is generally not possible for user A to set user B as the
owner of a file system object, even if A owns the object. The
superuser ("root" in POSIX, "Administrator" in NTFS) can however
always set itself as the owner of an object. In POSIX, the superuser
may in fact set any user as the owner, but it NTFS it can only take
ownership.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.5 Permissions</h4>

<p>An entity can be given a set of permissions on a file system object
(e.g. read and write). The data structure holding the permissions for
one entity is called an "Access Control Entry" (ACE). As many users
and groups may have sets of permissions on a given object, multiple
Access Control Entries are combined to an Access Control List, which
is associated with the object.

   <p>The set of available permissions differ with ACL APIs. For example,
the "Take Ownership" permission in NTFS has no equivalent in
POSIX. However, for the most common situations, it is possible to get
equivalent security properties by mapping a set of permissions in one
API to another set in a second API.

   <p>There are however different rules for the access to the contents of a
directory with no access. In POSIX, no sub-objects of a directory with
no access can be accessed. However, in NTFS, sub-objects that the entity
has access rights to can be accessed, regardless of whether the entity
has access rights to the containing directory.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.6 Deny permissions</h4>

<p>If no permissions are given to a particular entity, the entity will be
denied any access to the object. But in some file systems, like NTFS,
it is also possible to explicitly deny specific permissions to
entities. Thus, two types of permissions exist in these systems: allow
and deny.

   <p>It is generally good practice to design the ACLs to specify who is
allowed to do some operations, in contrary to who is not allowed to do
some operations, if possible. The reason for this is that describing
who is not allowed to do things tend to lead to more complex
rules and could therefore more easily lead to mis-configurations and
security holes. A good rule is to only define that users should not be
able to access a resource in the following two scenarios:

     <ul>
<li>Denying access to a subset of a group which is allowed access
<li>Denying a specific permission when a user or a group has full access
</ul>

   <p>If you think about it, this is the same principle that applies to
firewall configuration: it is easier to white-list, specify who should
have access, than to blacklist, specify who should not have access. In
addition, since CFEngine is designed to be cross-platform and some ACL
permissions are not available on all platforms, we should strive to
keep the ACLs as simple as possible. This helps us avoid surprises
when the ACLs are enforced by different platforms.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.7 Changing permissions</h4>

<p>Generally, only the owner may change permissions on a file system
object. However, superusers can also indirectly change permissions by
taking ownership first. In POSIX, superusers can change permissions
without taking ownership. In NTFS, either ownership or a special
permission ("Change Permissions") is needed to alter permissions.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.8 Effective permissions</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, even though two ACL APIs support all the permissions
listed in an ACL, the ACL may be interpreted differently. For a given
entity and object with ACL, there are two conceptually different ways
to interpret which permissions the entity obtains: ACE precedence and
cumulative ACL.

<!-- TODO: create figure of example? -->
   <p>For example, let &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; be a user of the group
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">staff</span></samp>&rsquo;. There is an ACL on the file <samp><span class="file">schedule</span></samp>, giving
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; write permission, and the group &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">staff</span></samp>&rsquo; read
permission. We will consider two ways to determine the effective
permissions of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; to <samp><span class="file">schedule</span></samp>.

   <p>Firstly, by taking the most precise match in the ACL, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; will be
granted write permission only. This is because an ACE describing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo;
is more precise than an ACE describing a group &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; is member
of. However, note that some ACEs may have the same precedence, like
two ACEs describing permissions for groups &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; is member of. Then,
cumulative matching will be done on these ACEs (explained next). This
is how POSIX does it.

   <p>Secondly, we can take the cumulative permissions, which yields a user
permissions from all the ACE entries with his user name, groups he is
member of or the ACE entry specifying all users. In this case,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alice</span></samp>&rsquo; would get read and write on <samp><span class="file">schedule</span></samp>. NTFS
computes the effective permissions in this way.

<h4 class="subsection">7.2.9 Inheritance</h4>

<!-- TODO: Correct to inherit to someone ? -->
<p>Directories have ACLs associated with them, but they also have the
ability to inherit an ACL to sub-objects created within them. POSIX
calls the former ACL type "access ACL" and the latter "default ACL",
and we will use the same terminology.

<h3 class="section">7.3 CFEngine 3 Generic ACL Syntax</h3>

<!-- FIXME: TODO: Say which OS's we are supporting, and which ACL types -->
<!-- we are supporting on them. -->
<p>The CFEngine 3 ACL syntax is divided into two main parts, a generic
and an API specific (native). The generic syntax can be used on any
file system for which CFEngine supports ACLs, while the native syntax
gives access to all the permissions available under a particular ACL
API.

   <p>An ACL can contain both generic and native syntax. However, if it
contains native syntax, it can only be enforced on systems supporting
the given ACL API. Thus, only the generic syntax is portable.

   <p>Note that even though the same generic ACL is set on two systems with
different ACL APIs, it may be enforced differently because the ACE
matching algorithms differ. For instance, as discussed earlier, NTFS
uses cumulative matching, while POSIX uses precedence
matching. CFEngine cannot alter the matching algorithms, and
simulating one or the other by changing ACL definitions is not
possible in all cases, and would probably lead to confusion. Thus, if
an ACL is to be used on two systems with different ACL APIs, the user
is encouraged to check that any differences in matching algorithms do
not lead to mis-configurations.

   <p>The CFEngine generic ACL syntax explained next, and native syntax is
described in following sections.

<li><code>acl_alias</code> is the name of the specified ACL. It can be any
  identifier containing alphanumeric characters and underscores. We
will use this name when referring to the ACL.

     <li><code>acl_type</code> (optional) specifies the ACL API used to
describe the ACL. It defaults to <code>generic</code>, which allows only
CFEngine generic ACL syntax, but is valid on all supported
systems. <code>acl_type</code> only needs to be specified if native
permissions are being used in the ACL (see <code>nperms</code> below). If
<code>acl_type</code> is set to anything other than <code>generic</code>, the
system on which it is enforced must support this ACL API.

     <li><code>acl_method</code> (optional) can be set to either
  <code>append</code> or <code>overwrite</code>, and defaults to
  <code>append</code>. Setting it to <code>append</code> only adds or modifies the
  ACEs that are specified in <code>aces</code> (and
  <code>specify_inherit_aces</code>, see below). If set to
  <code>overwrite</code>, the specified ACL will completely replace the
  currently set ACL. All required fields must then be set in the
  specified ACL (e.g. <code>all</code> in POSIX), see the following sections
  describing the supported native APIs.

     <!-- TODO: Support acl_method:append for specify_inherit_aces independently? -->
     <li><code>acl_directory_inherit</code> (optional) specifies the ACL of
  newly created sub-objects. Only valid if the ACL is set on a
directory. On directories, <code>nochange</code> is the default and
indicates that the ACL that is currently given to newly created child
objects is left unchanged. If set to <code>clear</code>, no ACL will be
inherited, but the file system specifies a default ACL, which varies
with the file system (see the following sections on the supported ACL
APIs). <code>parent</code> indicates that the ACL set in <code>aces</code> (see
below) should be inherited to sub-objects.  If set to <code>specify</code>,
<code>specify_inherit_aces</code> specifies the inherited ACL, and
<code>acl_method</code> applies for <code>specify_inherit_aces</code> too.

     <li><code>aces</code> is a list of access control entries. It is parsed
  from left to right, and multiple entries with the same entity-type
  and id is allowed. This is necessary to specify permissions with
  different <code>perm_type</code> for the same entity (e.g. to allow read
  permission but explicitly deny write).

     <li><code>specify_inherit_aces</code> (optional) is a list of access control
  entries that are set on child objects. It is also parsed from left
  to right and allows multiple entries with same entity-type and
  id. Only valid if <code>acl_directory_inherit</code> is set to
  <code>specify</code>.

     <li><code>user</code> indicates that the line applies to a user specified
  by the user identifier <code>uid</code>. <code>mode</code> is the permission
  mode string.

     <li><code>group</code> indicates that the line applies to a group specified
  by the group identifier <code>gid</code>. <code>mode</code> is the permission
  mode string.

     <li><code>all</code> indicates that the line applies to every
  user. <code>mode</code> is the permission mode string.

     <li><code>uid</code> is a valid user name for the system and
  cannot be empty. However, if <code>acl_type</code> is <code>posix</code>,
<code>uid</code> can be set to * to indicate the user that owns the file
system object.

     <li><code>gid</code> is a valid group name for the system and
  cannot be empty. However, if <code>acl_type</code> is <code>posix</code>,
<code>gid</code> can be set to * to indicate the file group.

     <li><code>mode</code> is one or more strings
  <code>op</code>|<code>gperms</code>|(<code>nperms</code>); a concatenation of <code>op</code>,
  <code>gperms</code> and optionally (<code>nperms</code>), see below, separated
  with commas (e.g. +rx,-w(s)). <code>mode</code> is parsed from left to
  right. 
<!-- TODO: include support for @code{fullaccess}, @code{noaccess}, -->
<!-- and @code{remove} -->

     <li><code>op</code> specifies the operation on any existing permissions,
  if the specified ACE already exists. <code>op</code> can be =, empty, + or
  -. = or empty sets the permissions to the ACE as stated, + adds and
  - removes the permissions from any existing ACE.

     <li><code>nperms</code> (optional) specifies ACL API specific
  (native) permissions. Only valid if <code>acl_type</code> is not
  <code>generic</code>. Valid values for <code>nperms</code> varies with different
  ACL types, and are specified in subsequent sections.

     <li><code>perm_type</code> (optional) can be set to either <code>allow</code> or
  <code>deny</code>, and defaults to <code>allow</code>. <code>deny</code> is only valid
  if <code>acl_type</code> is set to an ACL type that support deny
  permissions.

     <li><code>gperms</code> (generic permissions) is a concatenation of zero
  or more of the characters shown in the table below. If left empty,
  none of the permissions are set.

<p><b>Native permissions</b>
The valid values for <code>nperms</code> in POSIX are <code>r</code>,<code>w</code>, and
<code>x</code>. These are in fact the same as the generic permissions, so
specifying them as generic or native gives the same effect.

   <p><b>File owner and group</b>
A user-ACE with uid set to * indicates file object owner. A group-ACE
with gid set to * indicates file group.

   <p><b>mask</b> mask can be specified as a normal ACE, as
<code>mask:mode</code>. mask specifies the maximum permissions that are
granted to named users (not owning user), file group and named
groups. mask is optional, if it is left unspecified it will will be
computed as the union of the permissions granted to named users, file
group and named groups (see acl_calc_mask(3)).

   <p><b>Required ACEs</b> POSIX requires existence of an ACE for the file
owner, (<code>user:*:mode</code>), the file group (<code>group:*:mode</code>),
other (<code>all:mode</code>) and mask (<code>mask:mode</code>). As mentioned,
CFEngine automatically creates a mask-ACE, if missing. However, if
<code>method</code> is set to <code>overwrite</code>, the user must ensure that
the rest of the required entries are specified.

   <p><b>Generic permissions</b>

   <p><b>Inheritance</b> POSIX supports <code>acl_directory_inherit</code> set to
<code>specify</code>. The <code>specify_inherit_aces</code> list is then set as the
default ACL in POSIX (see acl(5)).

   <p>If <code>acl_directory_inherit</code> is set to <code>parent</code>, CFEngine
copies the access ACL to the default ACL. Thus, newly created objects
get the same access ACL as the containing directory.

   <p><code>acl_directory_inherit</code> set to <code>clear</code> corresponds to no
POSIX default ACL. This results in that newly created objects get ACEs
for owning user, group and other. The permissions are set in
accordance with the mode parameter to the creating function and the
umask (usually results in 644 for files and 755 for directories).

   <p><b>Further reading</b> The manual page <code>acl(5)</code> contains much
information on POSIX ACLs, including the access check algorithm. In
particular, this shows that POSIX uses ACE precedence matching, and
exactly how it is done. Operating systems usually bundle tools for
manipulating ACLs, for example <code>getfacl(1)</code> and
<code>setfacl(1)</code>.

<p><b>Native permissions</b>
NTFS supports fourteen so-called special file permissions. However, we
do not consider the <code>Synchronize</code> permission because it is used
for a different purpose than the other permissions. In order to give
access to the thirteen relevant permissions, CFEngine defines a native
permission flag for each of them. This one-to-one mapping is as
follows.

   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>The semantics of these special permissions can be found in the
references for further reading below.

   <p><b>Denying permissions</b>
NTFS supports setting <code>perm_type</code> to <code>deny</code> in addition to
<code>allow</code>, which is the default. This can for instance be used to
denying a user a particular permission that a group membership grants
him. It is important to note that the precedence of allow and deny
permissions is as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Explicit Deny
<li>Explicit Allow
<li>Inherited Deny from parent
<li>Inherited Allow from parent
<li>Inherited Deny from grandparent
<li>Inherited Allow from grandparent
<li>...
        </ol>

   <p>Thus, the closer the permission is to the object in the directory
path, the greater precedence it is given.

   <p>An important point here is that even though a user is denied access in
a parent directory and this permission is inherited, but one of the
groups he is member of is explicitly allowed access to a file in that
directory, he is actually allowed to access the file.

   <p><b>Ownership</b>
In NTFS, the default owner is the user who is currently logged on. The
only exceptions occur when the user is a member of either the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Administrators</span></samp>&rsquo; group or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Domain Admins</span></samp>&rsquo; group.

   <p>Owners of NTFS objects can allow another user to take ownership by
giving that user Take Ownership permission. Owners can also give other
users the Change Permissions flag. In addition, members of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Administrator</span></samp>&rsquo; group can always take ownership. It is never
possible to give ownership of an object to a user, but members of
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Administrator</span></samp>&rsquo; group can give ownership to that group.

<h4 class="subsection">7.5.2 Generic syntax mapping</h4>

<p><b>Entity types</b>
The three entity types of NTFS are called user, group and
Everyone. The user and group entity types in NTFS are mapped to the
user and group entity types in CFEngine. Everyone is mapped to all in
CFEngine.

   <p><b>Generic permissions</b>
For NTFS, CFEngine maps the <code>gperms</code> to <code>nperms</code> as
follows.

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="30%">Generic flag  </th><th valign="top" width="30%">Native flags
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>r</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>rtTp</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>w</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>wabB</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>x</code> </td><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>x</code>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>The rationale for this mapping is discussed next.

   <p>NTFS groups the thirteen special permissions to create five sets of
permissions:
     <ul>
<li>Read
<li>Read &amp; Execute
<li>Write
<li>Modify
<li>Full Control
</ul>
   In addition, we have the List Folder Contents set, which is equivalent
to the Read &amp; Execute set but is only available to- and inherited by
directories. The Full Control set is unsurprisingly all the thirteen
special permissions. An overview of the NTFS mapping of special
permissions to sets is given in the references stated as further
reading below. The NTFS permission sets can be expressed in CFEngine
syntax as follows.

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="30%">NTFS sets  </th><th valign="top" width="40%">CFEngine gperms|(nperms)
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Read</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>r</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Write</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>w</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Read &amp; Execute</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>rx</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Modify</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>rwx(d)</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="30%"><code>Full Control</code> </td><td valign="top" width="40%"><code>rwx(dDco)</code>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p><b>Inheritance</b>
<code>acl_directory_inherit</code> set to <code>clear</code> disables
inheritance, such that child objects get a default ACL specified by
the operating system, namely Full control for the file object creator and
<code>SYSTEM</code> accounts.

   <p><b>POSIX compatibility</b>
Be aware that setting <code>gperms</code> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; on directories is
more restrictive in NTFS than in POSIX ACLs. This is because NTFS does
not allow deletion of objects within a directory without a Delete
Sub-folders and Files permission on the directory (or a Delete
permission on the object itself), while in POSIX, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; on the
directory is sufficient to delete any file or directory within it
(except when the sticky-flag is set on the directory). Thus, on
directories, the NTFS-equivalent to POSIX <code>gperms</code> set to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx(D)</span></samp>&rsquo;. However, for files, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rwx</span></samp>&rsquo; is
equivalent in POSIX and NTFS semantics.

   <p>In POSIX ACLs, there is no explicit delete permission, but the
execute, write and sticky permissions on the containing directory
determines if a user has privileges to delete. In POSIX, the owner and
root can change permissions, while usually only the root may change
the ownership, so there is no direct equivalent to the Change
Permission and Take Ownership in POSIX.

into sets is given at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419</a>.

   <p>The promise looks exactly like a promise for a file object, but the data
are literal and entered into the policy. This is a useful approach for
distributing password hashes on a need-to-know basis from a central location. 
The server configuration file need not be distributed to any client, thus
only authorized systems will have access to the hashes.

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine 3 Enterprise supports notion of `environments' &ndash; named groups of hosts, like
`development', 'QA' and 'production' hosts.

   <p>Each environment gets
     <ul>
<li>Separate subdirectory `environment_&lt;NAME&gt;' for storing promises
<li>Separate subdirectory `environment_&lt;NAME&gt;/cdp_inputs' for content-based policies
<li>grouping of hosts belonging to environment in GUI
</ul>

   <p>Default CFEngine 3 Enterprise policies group hosts into environments in bundle `common
environments'. This bundle defines
     <ul>
<li>`environments.active' variable. This variable holds the name of environment for current host, and is used by other promises in CFEngine 3 Enterprise templates. This variable does not affect grouping in GUI. 
<li>global `environment_&lt;NAME&gt;' class. This class should be defined if given host belongs to the `&lt;NAME&gt;' environment. GUI groups hosts using this class. 
</ul>
   Administrator may customize this bundle as needed, adding or removing
environments defined (CFEngine 3 Enterprise does not have any built-in environment
names), changing rules for hosts selection and making any other
modifications, the only requirement for environments feature to work
is keeping aforementioned variables and classes defined. Note that the
environment name 'any' is reserved.

   <p>Default rules expect file `environment_$(promises.active)/promises.cf'
to exist and to contain bundle `agent main', this bundle is included
last from main promises.cf and should implement/include/use any
environment-specific rules.

   <p>Promotion of rules is performed by copying rules from one

<h3 class="section">10.1 What are virtualization and cloud computing?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Virtualization refers to the ability to run multiple host instances on
a single physical node. Cloud computing typically refers to what is
called `platform as a service', or deployment of virtual machines on
demand, often as an on-line service.

   <p>In this document, virtualization support refers specifically to
hypervisor technologies supported by the open source library layer <i>libvirt</i>
project, which includes interfaces for Xen, KVM, Vmware-ESX, and more. 
CFEngine thus integrates freely with other tools based on this library, such
as <i>virsh</i> and the <i>Virtual Manager</i> graphical user interface.

<h3 class="section">10.2 Why build virtualization support into CFEngine?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Virtualization engines (usually called supervisors or hypervisors) are
seeing an explosion of development. They exist as a number of projects
in various stages of maturity. The libvirt project was designed as
an integration layer based on an XML specification.

   <p>The tools for management are still quite primitive and require much
manual work. CFEngine has a unique role to play in maintaining desired
state in virtual machine systems.

   <p>In the cloud, virtual machines may be rented from remote commercial
providers, and managed as disposable resources. Convergent or
`self-healing' maintenance is an essential method for managing
machines that are geographically remote and awkward to access, e.g. 
machines in other time-zones that it is impractical to monitor by
legacy methods.

<h3 class="section">10.3 What can CFEngine do with virtual machines?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The simple answer is: most things that <i>libvirt</i> can do, with added
convergence to a desired state: that means, creating, destroying and
starting and stopping machines. By starting virtual machines through
CFEngine, you can be sure that a given `virtual guest' is running on
one and only one physical host, thus avoiding conflicts that are
difficult to detect with centralized systems.

   <p>CFEngine does not support everything that libvirt does &ndash; it offers a
simplified interface that is meant for robustness, stability and
hands-free repeatability.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine does not use libvirt's TLS based web communication layer.  It
manages every host as an independent entity, in typical CFEngine
fashion, using CFEngine's own distributed cooperation to provide the
implicit communication.  CFEngine does not currently support so-called
`live migration' of virtual machines.

<h3 class="section">10.4 Guest environments promises</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

A virtual machine is one example of what CFEngine calls an `guest
environment'.  You can promise to create (and host) an guest
environment with certain attributes, just as you can promise to host a
file or a process. Here is a simple example:

<pre class="verbatim">body common control
{
bundlesequence  => { "my_vm_cloud" };   
}

#######################################################

bundle agent my_vm_cloud
{
guest_environments:

   "myUbuntu" # the running instance name, defined in XML

       environment_resources => virt_xml,
       environment_type      => "xen",
       environment_host      => "my_physical_computer", # ipv4_10_1_2_3
       environment_state     => "create";
}

#######################################################

body environment_resources virt_xml
{
env_spec_file => "/srv/xen/centos5-libvirt-create.xml";
}

</pre>

     <ul>
<li>The promiser (in this case &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myUbuntu</span></samp>&rsquo;) is the name of the virtual
machine. This should be a unique identifier, as we need to be able to
refer to machines uniquely.

     <li>The guest environment host is the name of the computer that
is the host for the virtual machine.

     <li>Normally when we want to ensure something on a machine, we use classes
to decide where the promise will be made. For guest environments, however,
we need to make promises about the uniqueness of the machine. When you
make a machine instance you normally want it to be running on one and
only one host. So you want <i>every</i> machine to make a promise. On the
guest environment's host, you want to promise that the guest environment is
running, and on every other machine you want to promise that it is
not. In CFEngine, you simply include a unique class belonging to host
in the promise using <code>environment_host</code> and CFEngine assumes that
rest. Unique classes might include
          <ul>
<li>Hostname class e.g. <code>myhost_CFEngine_com</code>
<li>IP address class e.g. <code>ipv4_123_456_789_123</code>
</ul>
     </ul>

   <p>An alternative way to write this example is to quote the XML
specification in CFEngine directly. This has a few advantages: you can
re-use the data and use it as a template, filling in
CFEngine-variables. You can thus adapt the configuration using
CFEngine's classes.

<pre class="verbatim">bundle agent my_vm_cloud
{
guest_environments:

   "myUbuntu" # the running instance name, defined in XML
       environment_resources => virt_xml("$(this.promiser)"),
       environment_type      => "xen",
       environment_host      => "myphysicalcomputer";
       environment_state     => "create"
}

#######################################################

{
env_spec_file =>

}

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

CFEngine currently supports virtualization only through libvirt, so it supports
those technologies that libvirt supports. Currently this includes  most popular
technologies. You must choose the type of monitor that is to be responsible for
keeping the guest environment promise. In CFEngine, you should choose between a
machine environment or network environment of the following types:
     <dl>
<dt><code>xen</code><dd>A Xen hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>kvm</code><dd>A KVM hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>esx</code><dd>A VMware hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>test</code><dd>The libvirt test-hypervisor virtual domain. 
<br><dt><code>xen_net</code><dd>A Xen hypervisor virtual network. 
<br><dt><code>kvm_net</code><dd>A KVM hypervisor virtual network
<br><dt><code>esx_net</code><dd>An ESX/VMWare hypervisor virtual network. 
<br><dt><code>test_net</code><dd>The test hypervisor virtual network. 
<br><dt><code>zone</code><dd>A Solaris zone (future development)
<br><dt><code>ec2</code><dd>An Amazon EC2 instance (future development)
<br><dt><code>eucalyptus</code><dd>A Eucalyptus instance (future development)
</dl>

   <p>Once again, you must consult the libvirt documentation for details.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Distinct states</h3>

Libvirt recognizes a number of distinct states are transliterated into CFEngine
as
     <dl>
<dt><code>create</code><dd>Build and start an guest environment. 
<br><dt><code>delete</code><dd>Halt and remove runtime resources associated with an guest environment.

<h3 class="section">10.7 Example deployment</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Prerequisites: you need to make a `disk image' for the machine, or a
virtual disk of blocks that can be allocated. This image does not have to
contain any data, it will simply as a block device for the VM. You
can then install it by booting the machine from a network image, like a
PXE/kickstart installation.

   <p>If you want to allocate disk blocks as the file grows, you can create
a file with a hole. The following command will creates a file of
2048MB, but the actual data blocks are allocated in a lazy fashion:

<pre class="verbatim">
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/srv/xen/my.img oflag=direct bs=1M seek=2047 count=1

</pre>
To reserve all the data blocks right away:
<pre class="verbatim">
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/srv/xen/my.img oflag=direct bs=1M count=2048

</pre>

   <p>Libvirt uses an XML file format that cannot be circumvented. CFEngine
promises to honor the promises that are expressed in this file, as in
the examples above.  You need to find out about this file format from
the libvirt website.  To get CFEngine to Honor these promises, you
point it to the specification that it should promise using
<code>spec_file</code>.

   <p>You need to set up a network for virtual machines to communicate with
the outside world. This can also be done with CFEngine, using the
network promise types to build a bridge into a virtual network.

   <p>Then just run CFEngine to start, stop or manage the guest environments on
each localhost. Run in verbose mode to see how CFEngine maintains the states
convergently.

<h2 class="chapter">11 Content-Driven Policies</h2>

<p>In CFEngine 3 Nova 2.0, Content-Driven Policies (CDP) were introduced to make
policy management easier. In contrast to policies written in the
CFEngine language, these are semi-colon separated fields in a text
file that the user just fills with content. All the underlying
enforcement and reporting are taken care of automatically by CFEngine 3 Enterprise.

   <p>For example, to manage three Windows services, the following
services-CDP will suffice.

<pre class="verbatim"># masterfiles/cdp_inputs/service_list.txt

Dnscache;stop;fix;windows
ALG;start;warn;windows
RemoteRegistry;start;fix;Windows_Server_2008

</pre>

   <p>The meanings of the fields are different depending of the CDP-type,
but explained in the file header. With these three lines, we ensure
the correct status of three services on all our Windows machines and
are given specialized reports on the outcome.

<!-- The Content-Driven Policy services report is shown below. -->
<!-- @image{cdp_services_report,15cm,,The Content-Driven Policy services report,png} -->
<h3 class="section">11.1 Benefits of Content-Driven Policies</h3>

<p>As seen in the example above, Content-Driven Policies are easy to
write and maintain, especially for users unfamiliar with the CFEngine
language. They are designed to capture the essence of a specific,
popular use of CFEngine, and make it easier. For example, the services
Content-Driven Policy above has the following equivalent in the
CFEngine language.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     bundle agent service_example
     {
     services:
     
       "Dnscache"
         comment            =&gt; "Check services status of Dnscache",
         handle             =&gt; "srv_Dnscache_windows",
         service_policy     =&gt; "stop",
         service_method     =&gt; force_deps,
         action             =&gt; policy("fix"),
         ifvarclass         =&gt; "windows";
     
       "ALG"
         comment            =&gt; "Check services status of ALG",
         handle             =&gt; "srv_ALG_windows",
         service_policy     =&gt; "start",
         service_method     =&gt; force_deps,
         action             =&gt; policy("warn"),
         ifvarclass         =&gt; "windows";
     
       "RemoteRegistry"
         comment            =&gt; "Check services status of ALG",
         handle             =&gt; "srv_ALG_windows",
         service_policy     =&gt; "start",
         service_method     =&gt; force_deps,
         action             =&gt; policy("fix"),
         ifvarclass         =&gt; "Windows_Server_2008";
     
     }
     
</pre>
   <p>Writing this policy is clearly more time-consuming and error-prone. On
the other hand, it allows for much more flexibility than Content-Driven
Policies, when that is needed.

   <p>CFEngine provides Content-Driven Policies to cover mainstream
management tasks like the following.

     <ul>
<li>File change/difference management
<li>Service management
<li>Database management
<li>Application / script management
</ul>

<h2 class="chapter">12 Windows-specific features in CFEngine 3 Enterprise</h2>

<p>In this section, we will explore the Windows-specific features of the
native Windows version of CFEngine 3 Enterprise, and how it integrates with
Windows. We will also consider features that are more interesting or
popular on Windows than on other platforms.

   <p>Feature highlights include Windows service management and integration,
event logging, Windows registry repair, and fine-tuned file security
support through access control lists. See the sections on databases
and ACLs to find information on Windows registry repair and NTFS ACLs,
respectively. We will look at some of the other added features next.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Windows service management</h3>

<p>CFEngine 3 Enterprise can maintain complete control of the state of all
Windows services, in addition to Unix daemons. Services prone to
security issues or errors can easily be given a disabled state.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winservice-disabled_policy.png" alt="Disabled Windows service"></div>

   <p>A service can also be given a running state, in which case CFEngine 3 Enterprise ensures that it is running, and starts it if it is not, with
parameters if desired. More advanced policy options are also
available, including support for starting and stopping dependencies,
and configuring when the services should be started (e.g. only when
they are being used).

   <p>Furthermore, the CFEngine executor in CFEngine 3 Enterprise now runs as a Windows
service itself. This means it runs in the background an starts with
Windows, before any user logs in. It can be configured, started and
stopped from the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; listing in Windows.

   <p>Note that the name of a service in Windows may be different from its
&ldquo;Display name&rdquo;. CFEngine 3 Enterprise policies use the name, not the display
name, due to the need of uniqueness.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winservice-properties_name.png" alt="Windows service name and Display name"></div>

<h3 class="section">12.2 Windows event logging</h3>

<p>Event logs are the Windows counterpart to syslog from Unix. The main
difference is that event logs aim to group similar log messages,
giving each group an event id.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winevent-repaired-acl-closeup.png" alt="Promise repaired in Event Viewer"></div>

   <p>A program that creates logs, such as CFEngine 3 Enterprise, must define the
possible event IDs, and their meaning. In many applications, only one
event id is defined, a generic log message. However, CFEngine 3 Enterprise
defines the following range of event IDs, which allows for automatic
handling of log messages.

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="40%">Description </th><th valign="top" width="20%">Event ID </th><th valign="top" width="20%">Type
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise kept </td><td valign="top" width="20%">100 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise repaired </td><td valign="top" width="20%">101 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise not repaired due warn only policy </td><td valign="top" width="20%">102 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Error
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Promise not repaired due to error </td><td valign="top" width="20%">103 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Error
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Report promise </td><td valign="top" width="20%">104 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic information </td><td valign="top" width="20%">105 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic verbose </td><td valign="top" width="20%">106 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic warning </td><td valign="top" width="20%">107 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Warning
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="40%">Generic error </td><td valign="top" width="20%">108 </td><td valign="top" width="20%">Error
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <div class="block-image"><img src="winevent-notkept-storage.png" alt="Promise not kept in Event Viewer"></div>

   <p>The CFEngine 3 Enterprise event logs can be found under the &ldquo;System&rdquo; logs.  Almost
all monitoring products for Windows supports reading event logs, and
they can thus monitor logs from CFEngine 3 Enterprise as well. This makes it
possible to do more advanced querying on the status of a machine
running CFEngine 3 Enterprise, e.g. to show all promises that have not been
kept in a certain time interval. However, we recommend using the
Knowledge Map to do more advanced things, as it is specifically made
for this purpose and supports all operating systems that CFEngine runs
on.

<h3 class="section">12.3 Windows special variables</h3>

<p>Three new special variables have been added to the Windows version of
CFEngine 3 Enterprise.

     <ul>
<li><code>sys.windir</code> contains the Windows directory,
e.g. &ldquo;C:\WINDOWS&rdquo;.

     <li><code>sys.winsysdir</code> contains the Windows system directory,
e.g. &ldquo;C:\WINDOWS\system32&rdquo;.

     <li><code>sys.winprogdir</code> contains the program files directory,
e.g. &ldquo;C:\Program Files&rdquo;.

   </ul>

   <p>Note that these variables are not statically coded, but retrieved from
the current system. For example, <code>sys.winprogdir</code> is often
different on Windows versions in distinct languages.

<h3 class="section">12.4 Windows hard classes</h3>

<p>The Windows version of CFEngine 3 Enterprise defines hard classes to pinpoint
the exact version of Windows that it is running on, the service pack
version and if it's a server or workstation.

   <p>First of all, the class <code>windows</code> is defined on all Windows
platforms. For Windows workstations, such as Windows XP,
<code>WinWorkstation</code> is defined. On Windows servers, such as Windows
Server 2003, <code>WinServer</code> is defined. In addition, if the server
is a domain controller, <code>DomainController</code> is defined. Note that
if <code>DomainController</code> is defined, then <code>WinServer</code> is also
defined, for natural reasons.

   <p>The class <code>Service_Pack_X_Y</code> is defined according to the service
pack version. For example, at the time of writing,
<code>Service_Pack_3_0</code> is set on an updated Windows XP operating
system.

   <p>To allow taking specific actions on different Windows versions, one
of the following hard classes is defined.

     <ul>
<li><code>Windows_7</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2008_R2</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2008</code>
<li><code>Windows_Vista</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2003_R2</code>
<li><code>Windows_Home_Server</code>
<li><code>Windows_Server_2003</code>
<li><code>Windows_XP_Professional_x64_Edition</code>
<li><code>Windows_XP</code>
<li><code>Windows_2000</code>
</ul>

   <p>Note that all defined hard classes for a given system is shown by
running <code>cf-promises -v</code>.

<h3 class="section">12.5 Notes on windows policies</h3>

<p>A potential problem source when writing policies for windows is that
paths to executables often contain spaces. This makes it impossible
for CFEngine to know where the executable ends and the parameters to
it starts. To solve this, we place escaped quotes around the
executable.

   <p>Additionally, Windows does not support that processes start themselves
in in the background (i.e. fork off a child process in the Unix
world). The result is that CFEngine is always waiting for the commands
to finish execution before checking the next promise. To avoid this,
use the background attribute in the action body-part.

   <p>Both these things are demonstrated in the following example.

<pre class="verbatim">
body common control
{
bundlesequence  => { "main" };
}

bundle agent main
{
commands:

"\"C:\Program Files\Some Dir\program name.bat\" --silent --batch"
  action => background;
}

body action background
{
background => "true";
}

</pre>

   <p>Finally, one should note that Windows lacks support for certain
features that are utilized in Unix versions of CFEngine. These include
symbolic links, file groups, user and group identifiers.

   <p>Thus, the parts of promises containing these features will be
ignored. For example, the <code>getgid()</code> function does not return
anything on Windows. The reference manual documents exactly which
promises are ignored and not.  Also, <code>cf-agent</code> from
CFEngine 3 Enterprise prints warning messages on ignored attributes when run in verbose
mode.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Configuration of external authentication</h2>

<p>External authentication is available for CFEngine 3 Nova 2.1 and later versions, but by default the Mission Portal will use the embedded database to store user information (default user name and password on the Mission Portal login page are "admin" and "admin"). Note that users in the default database will be locked out of the Mission Portal upon configuration of external authentication. They will regain access if external authentication is deactivated by selecting the Database button on the Mission Portal Settings page (see below).

   <p>To enable external authentication on a fresh install, log on to the Mission Portal with the default user and password and go to "User Settings and Preferences" (see <a href="#User-Settings-and-Preferences">User Settings and Preferences</a>). Click "Mission Portal Settings" and enter the appropriate configuration for LDAP or Active Directory as described below. Note that the actual setup of LDAP or Active Directory (definition of users, directory hierarchy, etc.) has to be done independently and is not covered in this document.

<h3 class="section">A.3 Directory structure</h3>

<p>The Mission Portal imposes some limitations on directory structure for the use of external authentication. All users have to be stored in a direct child directory of the root (base dn). You may use subdirectories if you need to organize users into categories, but do not put more than one user directory directly under the root (base dn) as the user search will only cover the first encountered directory.

   <p>The same counts for group directories.
