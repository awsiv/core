<h3 class="unnumberedsec">What are Mission Critical Operations?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Mission Critical operation refers to the use and management of systems
where the availability and correctness of a system has to be ensured
at all times. A mission is said to be critical when any noticable
failure in the system would cause a signifiant loss to some
stakeholder.

   <p>Risk for mission critical systems deals with issues like monetary
losses (e.g. in time critical trading applications) or, in the worst
case, even the loss of human life (transport systems).

   <p>What makes a system robust in a mission critical setting depends on a
number of factors. This Special Topics Guide discusses the role of
CFEngine in a mission critical environment.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Factors affecting Risk</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

Risk is about predictability.  The ability to predict the behaviour of
a system depends both on the complexity of the system itself and the
environment around it, since interaction with the environment is what
usually provokes failures (the environment is the most unpredictable
element of any system, since it is the part over which we have little
control).

   <p>The cost of predicting and avoiding failures can be prohibitive in a
purely manual regime but automated systems can do a lot to reduce
costs. CFEngine can play a key role here in reducing the cost of
maintaining system state, even in a rapidly changing environment.

The key observation for dealing with mission criticality is that

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Model-based planning for stability</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

The key to handling mission criticality is to build a model of your
critical scenario that is based on a prediction of behaviour. In
science and engineering, this is something one does all the time
(e.g. wind-tunnel studies), but in Computer Engineering, the methods
of modelling are still quite undeveloped. 
In the nuclear power industry and space programmes, for instance,
it is common to use formalized fault-analysis to avoid and secure
against error.

   <p>The purpose of a model is to describe expectations. If a model is
sufficiently well conceived, it should be possible to identify key
causal factors in the mission that bring about critical behaviour.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
CFEngine's methodology is based on the idea of promises: a promise
being something that aims to alter our expectations of outcome in a
postive way. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In CFEngine, you make promises about the factors that underpin the
stability of your system, and CFEngine's task is to work on your
behalf to keep those promises. Promises cannot be guaranteed `kept' at
all times, especially in time-critical situations (such a guarantee
would require infinite resources to maintain), but a known schedule of
verification and repair allows us to bring a level of predictability
to a system, within certain tolerances. This is a best-effort engineering
definition of predictability.

   <p>Examples of promises that you might want to include in a
foundation for a mission critical system are things that
bring trusted stability, e.g.
     <ul>
<li>Check that key processes and applications are running. 
<li>Automated garbage collection that prevents a system from
choking on its own biproducts. 
<li>Scan for rootkits (security breaches) every few hours. 
</ul>

   <p>The economic aspect of mission criticality is key: the
loss of a key application or subsystem for even a minute could result
in loss of significant revenues in an online company, or the loss
of flight systems for a few seconds could result in a plane losing
control and crashing.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Strategy for Mission Critical Operations</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

There are many aspects to thinking about complete reliability of systems.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The main goal of any system is to seek predictability. Having clear
and accurate expectations of a system helps to steer it in a low-risk direction. 
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noindent">Usually these fall into a mixture of two categories:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Redundancy</i><dd>Elimination of `single points of failure' when failure strikes. 
<br><dt><i>Avoidance</i><dd>Proactive maintainence to keep the system in a zone of low risk. 
<br><dt><i>Certainty of knowledge</i><dd>Knowing accurately what is going in a system can enable correct decisions
to be made more quickly when something unexpected happens. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">It is impossible to discuss a comprehensive list of points for ensuring
reliability, but a few general principles come to mind:
     <ul>
<li>Maximize Mean Time Before Failure
<li>Minimize Mean Time To Repair
<li>Maximize the relevance of information from the system
to mission goals. 
<li>Separate procedures for handling change into those for intended change (planned changes to the mission) and unintended change (changes that should not happen in an ideal world), falling into two cases: expected (for which we have written policy to repair) and unexpected (incidents that are handled manually).

     <li>Certainty about information returned by the system, with multiple confirmation.

     <li>Graceful failure modes: failover servers, backups, automatic elasticity (e.g. cloud technology)

     <li>Peak load handling. (Also called Long Tail events.)

     <li>Design for self-correction (negative feedback controllers). 
This includes, low-impact of management overhead on the mission system to avoid
cascade failure.

CFEngine is designed to be a system that is resilient to failure. 
That, in fact, is the opposite of a high availability system,
where failures are not supposed to occur at all.

   <p>The Mission Portal has a role to play in Mission Criticality,
as it is a single source of information, collected,
categorized and calibrated for system engineers.  Being a single
source website, it is can also be regarded as a single point of
failure from the point of view of a mission critical application.

   <p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
The information in the mission portal is largely status information
about systems. The content of the Mission Portal database is not in
any way deterministic for the configured state of your IT system &ndash; it
is only a report of actual state, not a template for intended state. If the Mission
Portal is `down' or unavailable, it does not in any way imply that the
actual distributed system is down or that there is any fault.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Setting up redundant monitoring hubs</h4>

<p>If information and insight into your IT system are indeed Mission
Critical for you, it is possible to create a high availability access
to the mission information in the portal. 
In general, we recommend a small amount of professional services to
help set up such a system, as there are several details that need to
be taken into account.

   <p>The CFEngine star-network `hub', used in CFE Nova and CFE
Constellation is the report aggregator for the CFEngine software. 
CFEngine commercial editions support multiple hubs for redundancy
during reporting.  By making a cluster of three (or more) hubs, you
can ensure that reports will always be available and up to date, at
the time-resolution promised by CFEngine.

   <p>To set up redundant hubs, you will need three physical computers, or
at least three virtual machines on different physical computers. 
The idea is to use the underlying technology of the MongoDB database
to provide a replicated data store. If a single database server goes down
a secondary replica can take over the role. The commercial editions
of CFEngine interface with this database through <code>cf-hub</code>,
and this process can be made aware of the underlying replica technology
in the database. The architecture is intended to be as simple as possible
for the CFEngine user to employ.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
     <ul>
<li>Install each of the three systems with the Nova/Constellation extension package for
policy hubs.

     <li>The MongoDB backend needs to be set up specially before standard bootstrapping
of nodes in an high availability managed network. Alternatively, if you have already bootstrapped
hosts, you can manually establish hub redundancy with a little database infrastructure work
and some additional CFEngine configuration.

     <p>To do this, configure the Mongo database to set up a minimal replica set. This underlying
mechanism for automatic failover. For example, a configuration like the following should
be typed into the mongo client on one of the hub machines. Text like the following
example can be pasted directly into the mongo shell.

     <pre class="verbatim">     host$ mongo
     
     db.runCommand({"replSetInitiate" : {
     "_id" : "CFEngineNova",
     "members" : [
     {
     "_id" : 1,
     "host" : "10.10.10.1:27017"
     },
     {
     "_id" : 2,
     "host" : "10.10.10.2:27017"
     },
     {
     "_id" : 3,
     "host" : "10.10.10.3:27017"
     }
     ]}})
     
</pre>

     <p>To bootstrap the Mongo DB replication you should follow the procedure
from the <i>MongoDB Definitive Guide, O'Reilly</i>. An example is shown below,
assuming the three IP addresses for the hubs have IP addresses
10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, 10.10.10.2, we would arrange for the following
CFEngine pseudo-code to be executed before bootstrapping any of the
hubs:
<pre class="verbatim">     
     commands:
     
       10_10_10_1::
     
          /var/cfengine/bin/mongod --fork       \
               --logpath /var/log/mongod.log    \
               --dbpath $(sys.workdir)/state    \ 
               --replSet CFEngineNova/10.10.10.2:27017
     
       10._10_10_2|10_10_10_3::
     
          /var/cfengine/bin/mongod --fork       \
               --logpath /var/log/mongod.log    \
               --dbpath $(sys.workdir)/state    \ 
               --replSet CFEngineNova/10.10.10.1:27017
     
</pre>
Although we write the above in CFEngine pseudo-code, these steps need to be
carried out before boostrapping hosts, as the Mongo services need to
be initialized before anything can be written to the database, and the
bootstrapping of the license initialization writes information to be
stored in Mongo. During a single hub installation, these steps
can be automated, but bootstrapping the replication prevents
a fully automated installation.

     <li>Copy the public and private key from the licensed hub, along with the
<samp><span class="file">license.dat</span></samp> file to the secondary hubs. 
All hubs will share the same public-private key pair and license file.

     <li>Start the <code>cf-hub</code> on each of the three machines.

   </ul>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Next, we'll run through the operation and failure modes of the symmetric hubs. 
The arrangement of the hubs is shown schematically in the figure below.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Redundant hub architecture</h3>

<p>To set up redundancy, you create three hubs, each running a Mongo
database server and a <code>cf-hub</code> process will play the role of a
virtual cluster. All three hosts make promises to one another to
coordinate their data. The Mongo replica sub-system promises its own
coordination independently. We essentially make three completely
symmetrical hub hosts, with different IP addresses.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Set up three completely symmetrical hosts, with identical public-private key pairs. 
That is, generate a key pair only for one of the hubs and then copy those keys to
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.priv</span></samp>
on the other two hosts. This must be done manually to bootstrap
the hub redundancy.

     <li>The underlying Mongo database infrastructure binds together these hosts into a small cluster called a replica set.

     <p>A voting mechanism selects a `hub_master' from this set, which is going to be the active hub.

     <li>Each host is configured to copy the public keys from all the
others, so that they all converge on the same set of keys. The
following snippet shows the main principles involved in a replica
setup.

     <pre class="verbatim">     vars:
     
       "hub_hosts" slist => { "hub1", "hub2", "hub3" };
     
     files:
     
      am_policy_hub::
     
        "$(sys.workdir)/ppkeys"
            comment => "All hubs converge knowledge of client keys",
          copy_from => secure_cp("$(sys.workdir)/ppkeys","$(hub_hosts)"),
       depth_search => recurse("inf");
     
</pre>

     <li>For optimization we set up a policy that rewrites the IP address in <samp><span class="file">policy_server.dat</span></samp>,
to point existing clients away from a hub that is no longer responding, to the current master
or primary. Clients will initially pick up these changes by failing over, as in the previous point.

     <pre class="verbatim">     files:
     
      am_hub_master::
     
        "$(sys.workdir)/policy_server.dat"
             comment => "Point clients to the current hub master",
           edit_line => append_if_no_line("$(sys.hub_master)")
       edit_defaults => empty;
     
</pre>

     <li>To make the redundany hubs double as redundant policy servers, we make sure that
the copying of policy in <samp><span class="file">update.cf</span></samp> uses the replicas as failover servers
for policy updates. This means that changes to policy should always be copied to
<samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> on all three hub hosts.

     <pre class="verbatim">     body copy_from update_copy
     {
     ...
     servers => { $(sys.policy_server), "hub3", "hub2", "hub1" };
     ...
     }
</pre>
The policy server variable will point to one of these hubs. If a hub
host, doubling in its role as policy server, fails for some reason,
the clients will all fail over to the next hub, and updates will
continue. By the time this happens, we can expect the main policy will have been
adjusted by the edit in the previous point, and clients will be pointed to a new
primary.  It does not matter that hosts appear twice in the list; we
could, for instance place <code>hub1</code> last in the list if we assume
that hub1 is the initial primary, so as to minimize the wait due to a
double-failover.

        </ol>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
With this configuration, all the hubs promise to synchronize their keys,
and share `last seen' client host data with each other in order to symmetrize. 
However, only one of the hubs actually collected reports from the clients. 
This is the host that is elected by the MongoDB replica-set vote. 
</td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

With the approach taken above we can be sure that data are being collected redundantly
without duplication of network overhead.

   <p>Note that the standard Nova configuration files contains example
configurations for the replica set configuration. Integrating all the
settings can require extensive modifications, as mentioned above.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How do I make a change in mission-critical infrastructure?</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

To make changes in a mission critical environment, you publish a fully
tested, risk-assessed policy to <samp><span class="file">/var/cfengine/masterfiles</span></samp> on
all three of the hubs in the cluster. The policy on all hubs should be
the synchronized. It might be worth setting up a promise to verify
that the contents of these directories are the same between all hubs,
since unsychronized policies could cause serious issues.

<pre class="verbatim">vars:

   "hubs" slist => { "hub1", "hub2", "hub3" };

files:

  "$(sys.workdir)/masterfiles"

    copy_from => secure_cp("$(sys.workdir)/masterfiles","$(hubs)"),
       action => warn;

</pre>

   <p>All changes to a mission critical system should be classified
according to the level of risk to the mission. Changes fall into
different categories.

     <ul>
<li>Regular routine maintenance to the system (preplanned). 
<li>Course or goal corrections to policy (replanned). 
<li>Unforeseen repairs (unplanned). 
</ul>

   <p>In each case, we recommend that changes be made using CFEngine's
hands-free automation. Humans should never be the instruments of
change. By using CFEngine, you can get a documented and predictable
handle on change, using technology designed for stability with agility.

   <p>CFEngine has the ability to change entire systems of thousands of
hosts within a timeframe of 5 to 10 minutes.

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Separating Policy Changes from <i>ad-hoc</i> Changes</h3>

<pre class="sp">

</pre>

In mission critical environments, there are often struct processes for
approving change. Unintelligently applied, such rules can do more harm
than good &ndash; i.e. when the process for approving changes causes
greater risk to the survival of the mission than not acting at all does. It
is important to separate changes into categories that allow the
minimization of risk. If we take the categories in the previous
section:

     <dl>
<dt><i>Regular routine maintenance to the system (preplanned).</i><dd>Changes here have alredy gone through risk assessment, and root cause has been
deemed understood or irrelevant. These changes should be automated and implemented
in the minimum time. e.g. restarting a web server that crashed or was stopped accidentally.

     <br><dt><i>Course or goal corrections to policy (replanned).</i><dd>This is a change in the mission plan and requires significant impact analysis
for each change. Although many businesses are concerned about liabilities, the
real aim of this analysis is to mitigate loss.

     <br><dt><i>Unforeseen repairs (unplanned).</i><dd>These changes are usually discovered and repaired manually. Once some kind
of root cause analysis is performed to the required level, there should be
an analysis of how to automate the prevention of this kind of change in the
future.

<b>Using more than one hub at a time</b>:
If you want to be able to perform queries on any one of the redundant
