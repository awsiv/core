3.0.0	New classes enterprise, enterprise_X, enterprise_X_Y, enterprise_X_Y_Z
	on CFEngine Enterprise, to reflect the version running. New variable
	sys.enterprise_version that holds the CFEngine Enterprise version.
	This complements the Nova classes and the sys.nova_version variable,
	which will eventually be deprecated.

2.2.0
	More diagnostics on report collection from cf-hub. Logging more
	useful information in cf-hub -l, measuring total collection time
	in benchmarks report, under id "ReportCollectAll".

	Fixed issue where client would show as green in the Mission Portal when no
	data was received, e.g. due to access or license error at client.
	Now correctly shows as blue in these cases.

	Greatly reduced amount of connections from cf-hub
	to localhost mongodb. Now there is one connection per
	cf-hub run (max 50), before it was three per client.
	
	Software and variable report now contains end-node discovery time.

	Software and patches available/status reports contain maximum 5-minute old data,
	improved from 6 hours in last release. This will only apply to clients
	that are upgraded to 2.2.0.

	Software report query from Mission Portal is much faster on larger data-sets due
	to removal of autocomplete feature.

	Upgraded mongod from version 1.8.2 to 2.0.4, which increases
	efficiency on concurrency and reduces memory usage.

	New function hostswithclass() that generates a list of hosts in a given class
	on the hub.

	The bundled failsafe.cf policy now has trustkey=false to avoid IP spoofing
	attacks in default policy


2.1.0 
	New interface with interactive graphs on Nova hub.

	User management on hub.

	Allowing TAB in file diff report. Better handling
	of large diffs and attempts to diff binaries.

	Support for adding notes to all hosts and reports.

	Support for policy staging environments.

	Nova reports can be exported to file and imported manually
	using cf-report -x and cf-report -i.

	Faster collection of monitoring (vitals) data due to 
	new protocol and data structure.

	Long-term storage (one year) of diff and changes reports.

	The variables report got a last-seen column. Now variables
	are stored in the hub for a longer time like classes, 
	and not overwritten on every update.

	The report of reports-promises are shown in the promise repaired log 
	in the Mission Portal.
	
	New option cf-hub --cache, recreates the cache data needed
	by the web interface.
	
	Only showing the last seen host name and ip address when
	listing hosts and on the host page.

	Reliability improvements, especially when querying
	the variables report.

2.0.2 
	Much faster report querying.
	
	Allows to specify age interval when querying promise not
	kept and repaired.

	Promiser conflict identifcation.

	Built with Cfengine Community Edition 3.1.4.

2.0.1   
	Fixed promise query of not kept/promise repaired logs.

1.2.0
	Windows Event Logs include output_prefix if set, and which component 
	reported the event. The verbosity of event logs have been reduced
	by not including promise kept and repaired events, this can now be
	tuned with action.log_level.
	
	Take out network communications from total state calculation,
	as it gets counted twice.
	
1.1.2 
	Encryption problems fixed in Community Edition.

	Built with Cfengine Community Edition 3.0.4p3.

1.1.0
	Regular expressions in file paths supported on Windows by using
	forward slash as path separator.

	CPU utilization report on Windows.
	Users logged in report on Windows.

	On the Windows cf-serverd, requests for /var/cfengine are
	translated to $(sys.workdir)\Cfengine, and path separators are
	automatically adjusted ("/" becomes "\"). This yields support for
	more platform-independent promises and allows for automatic
	copying of reports from Windows clients to the policy server.

	Scale on graphs in the Knowledge Map, and different background
	color gives more readability.

	Special functions added for accessing remote classes for distributed cooperation.

1.0.0
	Reports added to cf-report for compliance, setuid, file_changes etc.
	Added csv format also
	
	Automating topic map integration of policy, with impact analysis
	using promisee and builds_on promises.

	Literal string lookup in server.

	Database SQL and registry functions added. Verification and sanity
	checking of SQL database table structure. Create and destroy
	databases convergently.

	Access control list support for Linux.

	Powerful and lightweight promises for Customizable monitoring and
	system discovery promises added to cf-monitord.
	
	Longterm memory for 3 year trend analysis.
