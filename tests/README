Nova Tests
==========

Requirements: php5-pfm, mongo, nginx
Environment assumptions: None

Description
-----------
Environment for running tests related to Nova independent of host configuration and data.
Configuration files, logs and sockets are in the conf/, log/ and var/ subdirectories respectively. Data sets are located in the data/ directory.

Utility scripts
---------------

  Loading data (load-data.sh)
  ---------------------------
  Takes a data directory and loads up the json files it can find there
  into the test-db directory (a mongo database).
  Example: ./load-data.sh data/rest

  Serving HTTP (serve-nginx.sh)
  -----------------------------
  Serves up nginx with conf/http-nginx.conf configuration. This will
  run virtual hosts rest (on 8888:/rest, conf/rest-nginx.conf) and mission (on 8080:/,
  mission-nginx.conf). Should not daemonize.

  Serving PHP (serve-php-fpm.sh)
  ------------------------------
  Serves up php5-fpm with conf/php-fpm configuration. Should not daemonize.

  Serving Mongo (serve-mongo.sh)
  ------------------------------
  Serves up mongod on default port 27777 with database test-db/. Should not daemonize.


Test suites
-----------

  Unit tests (unit/*_test)
  ------------------------
  Code-level tests for various modules.

  CFMod Memory tests (test-cfmod-memory.sh)
  -----------------------------------------
  Run the test suite in nova/cfmod/tests, checking memory sanity of cfmod.

  REST tests (test-rest.sh)
  -------------------------
  Run the test suite in nova/rest/tests, checking REST API functionality.
