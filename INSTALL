== cfmod ==

In order to manually install cfmod to the machine, you'll need to do the following:

1) Make a symlink from php library directory (typically something like
/usr/lib/php5/20100525) to $installdir/lib/php/cfmod.so

2) Put a configuration file (with .ini extension) to php configuration directory
(typically something like /etc/php5/conf.d):

extension=cfmod.so
